I hate reviewing co-worker’s PRs since he’s so rude with comments	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		963	"He asked me to review his PR and every time I comment something, he reacts condescendingly and aggressive. One example is I asked him to comment his functions on what it does since all the other functions have comments. He responded by accusing me of being too lazy to understand his functions and that told me to use google. Other times I comment on his code, he accuses me of not understanding how proper code looks.

My personality generally leads me to avoid confrontation. I’ve been trying to avoid commenting on his PRs in hopes he bothers someone else but he keeps reaching out to me so I have to deal with his aggressive comments.

What’s the best way to get out of this situation without escalating it? I really hate reading his replies back to my comment and don’t want to keep receiving snarky comments."	cscareerquestions

3 weeks is already longer than normal.  Maybe 1 extra week is okay,  but seriously I just want to move on because I was not happy there.

What do you do on days where you just can't focus?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		8	"So, every now and then I have one of those days where I can't just focus on the task at hand. It's not that I don't feel like doing it, or that I'm distracted by something: it's like I'm trying to focus but my brain is spinning its wheels in the mud and I cannot get the problem inside my head. The usual tactic of breaking the problem down on smaller problems does not work because the smallest division possible still requires a good amount of focus.

In these situations I'd leave it and use that time to get some mindless tasks out of the way, but we barely have any of those at my current job, so that's a no go.

Just leaving is not an option. Not doing anything is not an option either because I need to always report something at the end of the day (we do a sort of unofficial Kanban where we just pick tasks and work on them until the project is done eventually).

Here's a few things I tried, that sometimes do work, but do not on those days.

* The Pomodoro technique. This one helps immensely on most days, but those days it just ends up in 25 minutes of staring at the screen trying to not look at the clock.
* Going for a walk. I'm still unfocused after coming back.
* Exercise. It just makes me unfocused AND physically tired.
* Caffeine. Can easily backfire into being unfocused and extra anxious about it.
* Meditation. My mind may get cleared of thoughts for a moment, but the problem still can't seem to enter it. I have only tried the basic ""count your breaths, clear your head, focus on your environment"" meditation, I'm no meditation expert.
* Videogames, reddit, youtube or other entertainment. It can make my focus even worse.
* Music. It can make tedious tasks easier but does not help when I just can't focus.

In case you're wondering, I eat decently healthy, exercise regularly and sleep well, and those factors remain on the good days where I'm very productive, so that isn't it.

I'm at a loss on what to do. Do any of you have some technique that I haven't tried? Because these days are extremely frustrating and go by very slowly."	cscareerquestions

Should I decline the offer now or wait?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	6	1	" 

So I have been applying for internships and interviewing for about 2 months now, and last Monday I got an offer from a very shady company, it's UK based, but operates offshoring services in my country, it's remote which I think is not ideal for an undergraduate looking to expand their skills. Also, the offer was verbal since I don't think they have an office in my country, so there won't be any signing and stuff.

So yesterday I got another verbal offer from a reputable company in my country, it's 4 days/week and not WFH, which I like.

The pay is 3x what the UK company is offering, but the only problem is that I am supposed to start with the UK company next Saturday and the other company said the offer will be ready on Sunday, I only got a verbal offer from them.

So what should I do, should I tell the first company I changed my mind and risk not getting a written offer from the second company if they for whatever reason decided to change their mind, or should I start working for the first company and leave when the second offer comes?

Position is Full Stack Developer Intern in both companies.

People shit on LeBron for switching teams…but at least he delivered a championship to every team he’s been on	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		13310	"
LeBron made a 3-1 comeback in the Finals against a 73-9 team with Kyrie. KD couldn’t even last two proper seasons with him before requesting a trade. As soon as things get tough, KD goes around building teams that can't lose. 

LeBron joins his friends to beat his enemies. Durant joins his enemies to beat his friends. Major difference. One still shows respect to the spirit of competition, the other completely disregards competition &amp; what sports are supposed to be about.

TLDR: Durant has done more damage to his sport than any other athlete ever has and people let him get away with it because they have such an irrational hatred for LeBron. It's sick."	nba

Why is it so difficult to get ahead?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		313	"My job/career life has been a whirlwind since 2020. From the start where unemployment gave me a decent cushion to live off of, and support for between gaps in jobs (up to 4 now), to it all being taken back by taxes this year. To now being worse off than I was before all this started. And I have no clue if this new job is 1) even going to last on my part or 2) last through the oncoming recession. And the thought of trying to fit a job interview into my 30min lunch break or after 5pm is miserable and/or nearly impossible.

Even more infuriating, I keep hearing how people are leveraging their jobs and negotiating for higher salaries. But yet ANY attempt I have made in doing so, seems like it immediately disqualifies me from the position. And the amount of lowball offers (less than or equal to $40,000) I keep getting as a college graduate with 10+ years career experience is unbelievably insulting. So are the headlines being exaggerated? Am I just a failure? But for fucks sake, why in the absolute fuck is it so hard to get ahead in life? 

I feel like the life I was promised was a defunct, boldface lie. And I fell for it, hard. Working is essentially a way to breakeven now, not get ahead. Owning a home has been ripped from the table, and best of luck getting a woman to come around to the idea of having a family with me if I can't purchase one of those. I feel completely lied to and it's led to this level of demoralization that I've never felt before. I have done all I was told to do in life and for what?

Is it bad to followup a third time when no response was received?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		16	"I interviewed at an banking company for an IT job and went through 3/4 rounds of interviews spanning 3 weeks. The day after the third round, I received a call from the manager saying the team liked me and are interested in making an offer. It's been 3 weeks since that call and the manager has not responded to any of my 2 follow up emails. Should I assume they've given up on me? I'm considering emailing the manager one last time.
During the call 3 weeks ago, I did not sense that the logistics of my asking salary and relocation would be too much. Everything sounded like it met their and my expectation. So I'm confused why I haven't heard back in 3 weeks. Any insights from anyone are much appreciated."	jobs

My toxic manager is literally making me have panic attacks.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		12	"So where should I start? I started this job as a hotel receptionist in a big chain hotel this past December. At first everything was great. Granded this company  has many issues. For example we are very understaffed and the amount of work receptionists have to do is ridiculous. On top of the usual receptionist duties we also manage the reservations, emails and do some of the accountant's work. All this while we pick up phones,  do the check ins and outs, manage guest complains, giving information, booking taxis and restaurant reservations etc. 

Anyways so my manager is liberally micromanaging to the point that it drives you insane. He demands that we inform him about ANY guest issue that may arise in our shift. Even something as small as changing rooms or the guest not liking the weather. Anyways, except from that he will call in meetings over ant sightly negative review and will yell at us even if we explain it didn't happen like the reviewer said. He once called me an idiot over a small mistake. The shifts are so busy that sometimes we forget to mention a small guest issue. Last week he demanded an apology letter of me because I forgot to mention that the guest didn't like the menu so the chef made something else. I always stay more than the 8 hours my shift is because of the amount of work we have to do but he won't acknowledge it. 

He never gives any positive feedback, he always criticises my work and he will often call me to tell me about a mistake I made. No matter the time. He makes me scared to do my job bc I don't know when he'll explode.

Just quit my job and I have interviews lined up this week. Should I tell employers I still work at my other job?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		8	"My previous role had a lot of issues; my entire department quit, actually. I emailed my resignation and didn’t work out a two weeks notice because I tried to have a conversation with my director and supervisor about the amount of work I was being given (I was doing the job of two other employees that had quit as well) and in my role I was placed in a different business to assist with their customers, sort of like a contractor. I was facing harassment and the employees I worked with there made constant, really grotesque racist, sexist, and homophobic comments daily and I was uncomfortable and wanted to be moved. They literally told me that it would be good for me to grow a thicker skin in the workplace, and seemed more annoyed that I brought up the issue in the first place.

All that being said—yeah, quit without notice because I couldn’t stand to be there any longer. I had been applying for jobs and have interviews this week. Would it be easier to say I still work there so they wouldn’t expect a reference, or is that a bad idea? Or should I try to explain in the interviews why I left?

The Man From Toronto is the worst movie (with A listed actors) I have seen in a long time	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	332	507	"This movie is just so bad. It had a few funny one liners, but other than that, it’s terrible.

The jokes feel like they were written by 16 year olds that find Dane Cook funny. They were so lazy, you could see them coming a mile away, just “butt joke” type humor. 

There was absolutely no tension in any scene, because even if that’s what they were going for, Hart would say something stupid in an attempt to make you laugh, and the whole thing just feels flat.

It also had the lamest attempt at trying to insert some gender pronounce etiquette randomly into the scene, it felt like product placement or something.

The whole thing just sucked. I believe Jason Stratham was originally cast as the man from Toronto. I don’t think he would have saved the movie, but I feel like the dynamic between him and Hart would have been funnier and more entertaining. Anyone know why he lost the role? 

Anyway, just a rant!

Edit: also I hate how the gym fight seen, while being pretty fun and cool, felt like it was from a completely different movie. The colors changed, the theme changed, the music choice…it’s like it was straight from Crank or some older Jason Statham movie, and then back to this."	movies	2022-07-01T04:24:32.000Z	ak22801

I'm assuming that since so much screen time is missing, entire scenes and sub-plots were straight up taken out and it wasn't just trimmed footage from existing scenes.

It's strange that such a substantial chunk of the movie was taken out yet the ""butchered"" 2 hour versions (theatrical or the slightly tinkered director cuts) are now considered the completed movie, when it was radically changed in the editing room with Mann's approval. Usually directors disown their movies in such situations but Mann seems content with the 2 hour long versions.

For comparison, the directors cut of Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven is 50 minutes longer than the theatrical cut and those 2 versions differ tremendously."	movies	2022-07-01T08:44:48.000Z	Britz94

HARVEY : Your men your plan!

```
Exactly!

JOKER : Do I really look like a guy with a plan? 

```
Yes you do! all of this were planned by you and they all went according to your plan.
```

JOKER : You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught one, you know I just do things.

``` bullshit, when batman asked for the locations of Harvey and Racheal, you intentionally gave him the wrong location because you wanted Racheal to die. Also you pre-planned your own escape from GCPD jail cell. doesnt sound like someone who's ""just doing things""...```

JOKER : The mob has plans. The cops have plans. Gordon's got plans. You know, they're schemers.. Schemers trying to control their little worlds... I'm not a schemer.. I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are

``` doesnt make any sense. Wouldn't Gotham be much worse if police didnt make an effort to supress crime? It would be.. That means their efforts have results.. then how is it pathetic? ```

JOKER : So when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal you'll note that I'm telling the truth.

``` Doesnt matter what his intentions were, joker still resulted in Racheal's death. You can't kill someone and say it wasnt really personal to the victim's loved ones and expect them to not be angry with you. But Harvey does exactly that. He lets a coinflip decide if joker should be punished instead of straight up killing joker when joker hands him the pistol. That doesnt seem like something a person who lost a loved one would do ```

So how's harvey so stupid to not get this? Harvey should be able to realize that joker's playing games on him and should try to ruin joker's plan, that is by helping GCPD catch the joker. He instead goes on killing people and threatening Gordon's family, which is exactly what joker wanted. How's he stupid enough to fall into joker's trap, that makes no sense

So what I dont understand is:  why Harvey, a guy who has enough politicak expirience to become the mayor, fell for Joker's obvious &amp; stupid trap

Reddit is filled with creeps and degenerates and I’m tired of it.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		718	"The other day I literally saw a subreddit with Lolis and how men kept saying they wanted to fuck her etc, I reported the whole Reddit account but Reddit didn’t even do anything. I’ve made comments talking about how Reddit is so swarmed with pedos and sickos and I literally got more than 50 downvotes for that.

I talked about how age-play is questionable as it literally sexualises child like behaviours/children clothes and mannerisms and I got downvoted into oblivion for that. Not to mention a guy blatantly saying he got off to the idea of raping women and I said that hud behaviour was predatory and got downvoted again into oblivion.

This kind of thing wants to make me quit Reddit, it seems like it’s filled with overweight trashy men with absolutely no life skills who want to convince themselves that their awful predatory behaviour is ok. I’m so sick of some users telling 16 -17 year old girls it’s ok for them to date 30 year olds. It’s so harmful but Reddit turns a blind eye on it.

Im also sick of those perverts talking about a minor (under 18) year old sleeping with a 40 year old as if it’s a true story, but it’s just a sick fantasy that they want to get off to or make it seem more socially acceptable.

My husband’s anti social ways are making me resent him	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1124	We just got invited over to some acquaintances house for the 4th. We know these people through my sister. I thought it sounded like a fun day! I hesitantly told my husband to see if I could convince him to go. His reaction was what I expected. He immediately said NO and said “I could find a million other things to do.” I’ve been dealing with this for 20 years. He gets mad if I invite our neighbors for dinner who are our age and we get along with them very well. Every single time I want to hang out with people who aren’t his family he gets irritated. I need friends in my life and I feel like he hinders this.	offmychest

My brother's a pedophile and my family's going up in flames	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		655	"Throwaway account. 

My (F31) brother (29) was arrested last week in a no-knock federal raid related to child pornography. He's being held without bail and is looking at significant prison time. The last five days went from denial (""It was entrapment! The agents baited him"") to terror (""Fifteen years in prison??"") to action (""Private defense attorney evaporating tens of thousand of dollars from my mom's retirement with one signature"") to confusion (""What? There were hundreds of images?"") to rage (""I'm sorry what?? Mom knew he had a problem?"") to despair...realizing slowly and with just utter horror that my brother is a pedophile and he's spent a lot time being close to children. Children within the family. Many people are still in blind denial. I don't know how to move forward with my mother. My brain is not registering the information that my brother is sitting in jail - that it is, in fact, my brother who committed the crimes he's been charged with. And the kids...the thoughts just fall through my head like sand.

I've told two friends. One was quiet, but the second let me know abruptly that she didn't want to hear about it and it's really better to just keep it within the family. She said that she hadn't been abused, but that this topic is just so horrific and you never know when you're going to trigger someone. And she's right, but it made it even clearer that we are fucking alone. 

His actions have burned everything to the ground, and the story is just beginning to unfold. The misery has no bottom.

A letter to my ex husband	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		14	"I’m posting this here because I need to get it off my chest , I’m not looking for advice or opinions but I also can’t stop you from doing so since I’m posting this publicly. 

Dear you, 
It’s been a very hot minute now and I still can’t get you out of my head. I’m remarried now, and I’m much happier with him as a person than I was with you. I wish I could tell you so many things, like how you should be in jail for grooming me from a young age only to marry me to beat me and yell at me and treat me like how your mom treated you, then call it real love. 

I wish I could tell you about how little faith I have in men now, because of the things you’ve said and the people you’ve idolized while we were together, because now I’ve taken that horrible anxiety out on my husband and I feel like shit for it. Crying and shaking because he simply looked at some tiktok models and suddenly all of those feelings and words you’ve said to me flutter my head and tell me that I’m not pretty or endowed enough for anyone, and even though I’m only good for sex, I’m not the first thought that comes to your head when we made love. 

I wish I could tell you how many times I’ve cried about the trauma you’ve given me, even though I know you’ll only tell me that I’m the bad guy; which I now have engraved into my head and feel like I can’t get mad about anything or I’m a bad guy. 

I’m not allowed to feel the things I feel because I’m always afraid that I’m in the wrong, even though I’m always told to talk about my feelings to my husband. 

I really don’t care if people look at porn. In a relationship or not. But there’s just something about my husband even seeing these girls on tiktok who flaunt their bodies, that just makes me think of how I can’t compare , and then you’re right back in my head to tell me that I’m not worth anything. And then suddenly every one is my enemy , even the husband that I have now that I wanted to be with so badly for the past ten years. 

I need therapy. He needs therapy. You need therapy. And I’m sorry that you cried and felt the way you did when I left and it made you irrational when I tried telling you so many times that we were going to be a family, and you immediately thought it was someone else’s even though we had been living together for the past four months and you’d know if anyone was over or not. 

I hope that after I write this letter , read it a few times over in my head and delete it, that it’ll give me a better sense of emotional direction when little triggering things come up. 

I hope you never think about contacting me again or even look at any of my social media. I promise I don’t want you in my life anymore. 

You’ve created a monster insecurity in my mentality and I hate you so much.

Leaving... and He Doesn't Know It	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		11	"It's been a long time coming. 

This year he's been more violent, and alcoholism out of control. 

The straw that broke the camel's back though...

June 3rd I was driving at 12:30 at night to go pick him up from the bar. Tired and worn out, about 2 miles from my house, I got into a car accident. I hit a deer and completely totalled my car. I was on the phone with his mom at the time talking about the crazy day we had at work, so she immediately called 911 for me, as I rolled my car to the side of the road.

I called my insurance to get a tow out, and tried to call him to get a ride home from a friend or just in general find his own way home, that I had been in a wreck. 

His mom tried him multiple times, he rejected them. I tried him, rejected. I moved on to talking to my insurance to get it towed from the side of the road, and talking to the officer who came to the scene. 1am, bar close, he finally rapid fire dials me, so after a few times ask to step away from the officer, stating my SO was trying to call. I answered, saying I was in a wreck, not sure how bad it is but unable to drive, saying he needed to find another way home, from a friend or even a cab. I offered to pay for it, but needed to get back to the officer. He just gave me a ""pfft yeah"" and hung up. 

After talking more with my insurance, they gave an ETA for a tow in 2 hours. To keep liability and the paperwork down, I opted to stay with the car (but not without asking the officer for a ride home, which he said he wouldn't do, but whatever). 

I had been in a worse car wreck 4 years ago, and so as everything started to set in, I start having a big anxiety attack, so I called him to find comfort. He answers but says ""you fecked this up. You fecked this up so hard. Just like I knew you would."" (I have to drive him to work around noon everyday because he doesn't have a license anymore (DUI) so, sometimes I have to leave in the middle of my work day to drive him and I'll speed a bit to try and make it in time). He's screaming that he's freezing to death (40 degrees, not that bad), and it was all my fault and I needed to find him a way home. I gave him his options, call a friend or call a cab, I couldn't come get him and would pay the damn cab. He screamed more about how I fecked up, and I said I wouldn't continue this conversation and hung up. 

Called his mom who had been a huge support during this, she said he had called her for a ride (demanded she get in her car and drive to pick him up), but she had already been drinking since she had the next day off. I told her all of this and she was great, soothing and caring. He tried calling me again, so I hung up with her and called him back.. to more screaming. Eventually he started dropping remarks about harming himself. 

Eventually the tow arrives, and drops me at home. I call him to say ""home"" thinking maybe he could be worried about me... But no. Screams that he doesn't care that I'm home, he's still freezing and that I'm a huge B. I hang up on him and ask his mom who says to just send a cab to his last location, which I do as he messages me that I'm a fucking C U Next Tuesday 

He gets home about 20 minutes later, saying he's sorry he was mean and that I did t deserve that and that he's so happy I'm safe and he was ""so scared"" for me... He never asked how I was the entire time. 

And now I'm looking for an apartment alone. He's demanding I drive him to work and home from the bar, which... PTSD is a thing. I can't do night driving without a massive panic attack. He doesn't care.

And I can't tell him yet that I'm leaving because he may hurt me or my animals or be vindictive and ruin my work set up... 

I just wish I could find a place faster so I can stop pretending. Every kiss and I love you makes me sick. 

He choose booze over me for 3.5 years... And now I have to choose me."	offmychest

I Feel Physically Ill With Rage When I Here About People Being Cheated On Even Though I’ve Never Been In A Relationship	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	4	"I know the titles a mouthful but this is just weird. I see a lot of reddit readings on my TikTok and a lot of the times it’s stories about someone being cheated on.

I don’t know why but whenever I here about someone being cheated I get so mad that my chest clenches up, I feel so enraged and I have to focus on my breathing. I’m a teenager, I’ve never been in a relationship much less been cheated on but idk why this is such an issue for me.

Hearing about someone being cheated on basically makes me sick, I’m sure that’s most peoples reactions but like physically sick, like how could anyone do that to the person their supposed to love? How can someone be that cruel? I guess it’s naive to think that way but honestly if I was ever cheated on by a person I truly loved or had a kid with to top that I honestly don’t know if I could handle it, if just hearing anecdotes about cheating from people I’ve never met bothers me this much what happens if it actually happens to me?

What if it happens to me but I never find out about it? I feel like that’s worse. I have no clue why I feel this why, why cheating disgusts me so much but it’s kinda making me worry about the future, I feel like this has something to do with trust issues so like what if I’m not able to trust the person I’m supposed to love and because of me being overly cautious it drives them away, leading them to cheat?

I’m probably overthinking it, but overthinking it preparing I guess, maybe that’s an unhealthy point of view but I don’t care.

Idk why I feel this way, I’ve talked to people about it and haven’t really gotten an answer, I don’t know if I want advice or if this is just a rant but I just feel like I needed to get this off my chest."	offmychest	2022-07-01T12:26:40.000Z	Nathanial_Bleu
I am going to go blind	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		150	"I found out I have a macro adenoma. 

My health insurance is garbage and I can't afford to have the surgery, let alone the radiation needed to shrink the tumor. 

I am already in a financial hole because of an injury I had in 2020. 

I am unable to get disability, but I keep applying. 

I have no family to help me physically, let alone financially. 

They said if I don't have radiation the tumor will completely take over my optic nerve and I will be blind within a year. Not to mention, if I don't have the surgery to remove it after, it will just keep growing back. 

I have asked churches, catholic charities, tried to get hospital payment plans, friends, local charities... Nothing. 

I have talked with my insurance about waving the down payment, or helping me with a payment plan. They just said there was nothing they could do. 

The absolutely amazing social worker through the hospital said if I could come up with the 'down payment' that everything else can be sent to collections. 

The down payment is an absurd amount of money and about half what I make a year. 

How are people in the United States suppose to deal with health problems and everyday life, when the health industry doesn't care about making you better. They just want money. 

So, I will be blind by next spring. I won't be watching my kids grow up. I won't be watching them graduate, get married, or hold their own children for the first time.

Problem is my family’s asian and sadly medical illness is a taboo subject. I tried talking to my mom about my suspicions and get her checked medically.

I am baffled and I am speechless. My mom isnt even religious?? So I don’t understand how her teacher convinced her in one go. Now my mom is deciding to take her to church and pray to god every Sunday. I can’t believe my mom is trusting a teacher who knows my little sister for barely a month compared to me who’s been with her since she was a baby and have already noticed something wrong with her years ago.

I’m not sure what to feel and do.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	I just feel stressed. My friend and I had a fight (if that’s even one). So what happened was I sent her a screenshot about her “boyfriend” asking me to talk to her because she had an overdose. There wasn’t any problem with that, and I also immediately spoke to her about it and attempted to talk her out of it (this happened a day before learning about the screenshot then sending it to her).  Everything went downhill after I sent her that screenshot. Immediately detecting that something went wrong, I deleted the image and immediately apologized. After sending 2 long messages about apologizing for unintentionally reminding her of what happened and her probably now ex boyfriend, all she responded was “bruh.” Afterwards, she never talked to me, and I’m not sure on what I should do (it’s been 3 weeks). In my opinion, we could’ve talked about it, then she could’ve told me to prevent this from happening again. Any advice? Thank you.	offmychest	2022-07-01T12:26:40.000Z	SadbutRad1099
Etsy is terrible	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"I used to have a etsy shop a while ago. Stopped using it as I longer sell items but do art commissions. Just looked in my email and etsy fucking charged me on something I no longer used.

My account is currently -365
I can't afford this shit.
I don't make much from work.
I haven't had any commissions for a while. 

I hate my life at the moment solely on this fiancial crap. America is expensive to live and die in.

So now I went from -367 to now like -400 once it goes through.

Yes I emailed them, but its fucking Etsy. They don't care."	offmychest	2022-07-01T12:13:52.000Z	ReniaCoffeeCat
I want to become friends with my ex again	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		2	My first girlfriend broke up with me around 8 months ago after an 8 month long relationship and after she did I cut all ties with her because I was too upset to even talk to her, within that time I’ve grown as a person and become much more mature, and while for a long time I had nothing but hate for her, I now find myself appreciative of the relationship and the memories we had together. I understand why she did it and I don’t blame or hold any spite towards her anymore. We were very good friends before the relationship and I want to be able to talk with her on a normal basis again because we are in the same friend group but I’m too afraid of making things awkward. I’m also afraid that my current girlfriend will get the wrong idea that I want her back which isn’t the case at all.	offmychest		
technoblade fucking died lol	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		0	"i just couldnt stop thinking about it since this morning, it was the first thing i saw when i woke up so y'all can judge me as much as you want   
Honestly i feel like a part of me fell off, i dont know how i can say this but i've been following him since late 2019 and he's like, been there during my worst year 2020 and almost 4 surgeries in a single year time,, like whenever i would get some delicious food or snack to munch on i'd just watch technoblade's stream or past streams without even getting bored, i remember doodling his character all over my notebook when i was bored at class and now that he's just dead i just felt like this was some april fools joke but it isnt, i closed the ""so long nerds"" video a part of me still believes that he will post a video after a month like always :/ his cancer was already a heart breaking new for everyone and i just thought he'd beat it, but welp, no one is invincible, right? i had a tumor growing in my right hand and it was a mentally exhausting time, i just know how bad it was for him and i really admire how positive he was and how he kept his good humor during that time too. i'm a really positive person at all matters and tumor was exhausting for me with everything itself, i even dropped a half year of my school and went to therapy again, i just cant imagine how bad it was for techno and his family  
to be honest i'm not that much of an emotional person but when the things that i feel like wont change ever suddenly changes permanently without a turn, it just messes up with my mind man, it may sound like i'm exaggerating just a streamer's death but oh well, i think this was the same as my reaction to edd gould's death :/ it just feels like as if they didnt die, they are just resting to me  
welp, just like eren yeager said then,, some things changed forever amirite? i'll just have to get used to that"	offmychest		
Idk what to feel	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	You’re the first person who’s cared about me in such a genuine way. I’ve had a terrible upbringing and my entire life I’ve been trying to be a better person. I’m not one to open up about my past shit but I felt like I could trust you with it. Sure we were both drunk when we told each other but it’s frustrating. I care about you a lot, and  respect your relationship. You randomly went silent on vc today and it seemed like you were crying.

I opened up with my mental illness and got called weak	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"I've been struggling a lot with what I suspect is ADHD and maybe anxiety and depression. I recently received low grades and might get kicked out of my college program.

I opened up to my parents about it, as I've always had pretty decent and above average grades.

It ended with them screaming at me for being weak as they've given me everything I could possibly need— all I needed to focus on were my grades. I feel so so guilty because I definitely am privileged enough to not be struggling whereas they had a difficult life growing up.

Because of my mental health I've been having thoughts of self harm and suicide, and disappointing my parents right now has really pushed me toward that.

I have no support system, I don't open up to the handful of friends I have about this and I also view it as pretty embarrassing. My parents are financially supportive but emotionally hurtful. I feel like cutting my life short before my college even announces I'm out"	offmychest		
Tell me your thoughts	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		2	My bf said he would break up with me if he doesn’t see any change in me. I have very poor mental heath and I’m currently in a dark hole with it. Usually I try to dig myself out but I don’t have a single care in myself to want to do it. I think my depression and anxiety have gotten worse since those other times I tried to dig myself out so maybe it’s just harder to have that mindset now Idk. But I’ve given up each time so it’s like I know what the outcome will be. I don’t drive or have a license (driving anxiety), I don’t have a job, I’m not doing anything with my life. But it’s because I just don’t have the motivation to, everything and everyone gives me so much anxiety and I’ve gotten so comfortable with what I’m doing rn to where I don’t want to leave my comfort zone and I avoid anything that would make me uncomfortable. He pays all the bills I’m kinda just like a house wife but we are so struggling since I don’t have a job. My bf understands what I’m going through but isn’t understanding about it. He told me ”so you know how you need to get better but you’re not doing anything to change, idk what to tell you” We’ve been together for 5 years since I was 15 and he was 17. There’s many other factors of why I’m being the way I am at this point in life. My head is really messed up and I’m tired of dealing with it on top of life. How do other people like me do this. If this doesn’t make sense I am slightly drunk rn. Please be nice in the comments, tell me what I need to hear but don’t be so harsh please.	offmychest

I'm starting to loathe conservatives	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"I have always tried to be impartial: to look at a situation and impartiality weigh the pros and cons of different solutions without labelling them liberal or conservative. But due to.the recent advancements by the SCOTUS mixed in with news of other conservatives and religious zealots in my own country (India), I just can't respect them and their opinions anymore. I am turning into a narrow minded chump that supports one side exclusively because I personally do feel like every bad radical opinions and consequently bad decisions one can take; the conservatives are taking them all. It's slowly turning into a me v/s them kind of scenario in my head and I don't like it. Maybe I'll try to take a break from reddit, because I come to this app for funny memes and cute animals, but now there's one or the other bad news plastered all over it every single day. 

Also PS: I know there will be conservative under this post saying rude bullshit. To them: I apologise but I really do wish that all that you want somehow manifests specifically for all of you so that the rest of us can watch you crumble under the weight of what you wished for as you, with broken teeth, continue to uphold your frankly insane views; and we can make notes about what not to do in the future."	offmychest		
my cat doesn't like my vape	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		2	"I started vaping to deal with alot of stress and to have a different release then my usual barcode method so far it was working. I had a very stressful job time to myself was a very rare thing and I just got depressed.

I was staying at my parents one night and got to see my cat. I sat in my room vaping and my cat seemed to hate it.

She gave me weird looks and disproving eyes I realised that this was maybe a sign to cut down and stop altogether. 

I worship my cat I really do, I love her with all my heart and I feel so shitty about it. I stopped a few weeks ago because I wanted her to be happy even if I'm never home. 

I feel like it's such a small thing a look from a cat but I think she genuinely cares about me and would hate to upset her"	offmychest		
My housemates &amp; partner tell me to communicate...	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"I am living in London for about a year and half, and in a long distance relationship. I struggle a lot with mental health, and I am already looking into ways of getting help to properly understand how my brain works. I am incredibly emotional, very fidgety/nervous, very distracted, minor things trigger my fight-flight brain mode. 

The last few weeks I have been trying to communicate very clearly with the people that I interact the most in my life. I just feel like I cannot, like it is too much. My partner has asked me to put boundaries as he cannot be my only support, especially for things that are just kinda out of his control (I called him at 1am when I was stranded somewhere in London to get me an uber) which I completely understand. My housemates have told me to start going to them in these cases. 

Last night I forgot my keys, and got home kinda late because the public transport was delayed/buses not showing... I told my housemates and shared my location with them, also told them that I got very conscious about being a woman walking home alone at night from citymapper's night notification. My housemates decided to leave the keys outside and went to bed. In fairness to them, one of them has been sick all week (doing better now, she's going out tonight), and the other one has a deadline in a few days (but also going out tonight).

 I just felt really bad and not taken care of. I feel like I am a lot for the people around me... and like there is something intrinsically wrong with me that I need to hold back because I just take a lot of energy from the people around me. But everyone keeps telling me to communicate with them, but nothing is really changing since I am communicating. My housemates and I have had some sort of conflict before that was also centred around my way of communicating and just having to \*communicate better\* which I get but it's just making me internalise that every time I feel like I am not being treated with care or when something just simply bothers me, it is because I am not communicating well, or I am too emotional...etc. 

I don't know if this makes much sense, just confused and wanted to put it out to the world lol

Needless to say that I'm not an English native speaker, and especially on this topic, I struggle with my sentence formation. 

Have a great day everyone x"	offmychest		
insult, regreting, apologizing	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"What is said can't be unsaid. I know that. My long distance relationship. Personal struggles for other person, slow communication. Unselfish love from my side, hopeful while he struggles, patiently waiting for him to get healthy so we can focus on relationship.

He was about to come, visit me, after 5 month separation. After his situation finally resolved. I was so excited. I almost exploded. It's like waiting for something to happen, being afraid of the outcome, hoping and praying. 

We haven't sort out things, made a plan. I was waiting. He posted photo with one of his bestfriends(female), out on casual drink. Really nothing between them. She's an overweight ""influencer"", with massive lips almost ridicolous looking, exposing body on instagram. I got insecure. I was thinking why is he hanging with her but not making plan to see me which was supposed to be in 7 days.

I lost all of my months long patience, I responded to his story ""oh didn't know u prefer fat plastic frogs"". Which is so cringe and immature. I'm a fool. I apologized. He doesn't wanna speak to me nor come, neither forgive me. I mean, yes I f**ked up but c'mon. I don't expect instant forgivness. But communication, explaining shi*. I got into state of desperation, anxiety, Im aware I have to work on that. I lost control. 

I'd react the same way as he did. But also after being angry I'd question where is it coming from? What happened to loving person to act such a way. I'm awfuly sad and ashamed I litteraly ruined it all by myself.

What do you think?"	offmychest		
My manager just semi yelled at me and now I’m anxious as hell.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		7	"A bit of backstory, I (20f) had gotten a job in the middle of Covid at a small locally owned pizza place. I didn’t have the best mental health at the time and had a lot of anxiety with new things. My first day a almost blacked out (I luckily made it to the bathroom in time). The second day I had an anxiety attack and they fired me. Yes, on my second day. This really didn’t help my anxiety and mental health, it caused a lot of panic attacks and self doubt. 

Fast forward 2 or so years and I’ve gotten better mentally so I decided to try to get another job. I got one. This time at a very popular pizza chain and things went really well. I’m about 2ish months in and it’s been going pretty well so far. Well until now. Because it’s relevant I have to let you know that my management only gives out the work schedule a week in advance. Like I have to wait Sunday night to see if I work the following Monday. This isn’t really a big issue because I don’t have A life but it’s still annoying at times and makes it hard to plan things. 

I’ll admit though, for being a new hire I have missed a bit of work. I had caught Covid and I had to quarantine, then later I had gotten my vaccine which made me sick and I went home early. And then I had an event I had been planning for over a year. (I requested the time off and I had gotten it) 

My mom almost never celebrates her birthday. This year however she decided she wants to do something with the family so she made plans. These plans were really last minute but even then I still want to go because it’s my mom and my whole family is going. Unfortunately my schedule says that I have to work most of the afternoon that day and it’s right around the time they’re planning to leave to celebrate. So I figured this isn’t a big issue, i’ll just call them and ask if I can work late today or early the day of so I don’t miss work and I still can go with my family. 

Policy states that I have to call the store and request the manager to get days off/call in late. I tried calling the store twice but both times it got hung up on me. I don’t think this was the stores fault, just that if it rings a number of times and no one answers it automatically hangs up. So I figured instead of annoying the poor workers by calling over and over again I’ll just text my manager. Keep in mind they send my work schedule through the same text messages so it’s not like I’m texting my managers personal phone. (To my knowledge) 

So I text them and tell them that something had came up last minute for that day and offered to work late today or early the day of so I don’t miss out on work and I can make up the hours. They asked what it was for and I told them it was for my mom‘s birthday. This is where they semi-yelled at me, it was through text but it still came off as really angry and irritated. 

They said “Okay unfortunately your scheduled and expected to be here that’s not a reason to not be there for your scheduled shift I can try and see if someone will cover you but if not your expected to be there if you wanted the day there is a process to request days off “ 

At first I thought “ok, that was a bit rude.” But now I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been trying to act like I couldn’t care less because it helps with my anxiety if I trick myself that it’s not a big deal. But it is. To me at least. My mind has now been all over the place worrying about if I’m going to get fired or not or if my managers hate me and won’t be a good reference to any future jobs i’ll have to get. I just don’t want them to think that I’m a bad worker. I haven’t been trying to miss work it’s just that there was poor timing for a lot of things. 

So now I’m here typing this out. I’m hoping that getting my thoughts and worries on paper (or text) it’ll help me not be so anxious."	offmychest

I used to work at a grocery store as a bagger. I learned fast where I stood with women and men in general.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	36	163	Customers were always social and polite even making jokes with the cashier. But when they passed me they would quickly look away and dismiss me. Every day almost every customer. The women that worked with me never addressed me, and when I tried to talk with them they blatantly stopped talking to me and went to talk to someone that was attractive. Their whole demeanor changed laughing and jokingly flirting with each other. When they talked to me their voice was deep and serious and I was always the one to initiate the conversation. I overheard a group of the employees talking about me saying “he really looks different doesn’t he”. Right in front of me all staring at me. After about six months I quit. I couldn’t handle it anymore. Moral of the story if you are ugly don’t try a job where you heavily deal with the public. It sucks.	ForeverAlone	2022-06-30T22:47:28.000Z	alone-anonymous

Ever have those nights where you’re all alone, contemplating the failure you are as a person?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	8	29	"Just sitting in your room alone after a hard day of fucking up at work and just thinking about all the times you’ve fucked up in the past? With your thoughts indirectly justifying why you’re alone without a partner in the first place? Basically thinking to yourself “ofc no woman would wanna be with you, you suck at quite literally everything”.

21 years of age and I feel like I’m at where I should’ve been in fucking high school maturity, skill base, and relationship status wise. Just had a conversation with a friend at work and she was talking about this boy she’s shooting her shot with and it seems to be working out pretty well, I showed support and expressed my happiness for her while in the back of my mind thinking “damn, must be nice to casually find someone at work that likes you just as much as you like them, AND have them come to YOU”.

I hear all the time how work is a bad place to find a relationship when all I see are people hooking up around me almost effortlessly while I’m just there alone. The one girl I tried to genuinely shoot my shot with at work and had a good connection with I found out was lesbian… cool. If it’s not my own fuckups getting in the way it’s mere bad luck.

Feeling dead inside. TW	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	7	9	"Lesbian. I really want advice on what to do. I feel so fucking broken.

For as long as I can remember in my life all I've wanted is to be loved. I've also been suicidal since a kid. Like. 6 Years old

There are a few times I've gotten close to someone they ended up hating me. When my mental health health tool a dive in middle school is when things really went wrong. I had a few "" friends"" that I was madly in loved with. I became extremely obsessed with them and wanted nothing more then them. Even now mamy years later I want them and we haven't talked to in years. I easily become obsessed over any girl who is even slightly nice to me.

These two ""friends"" tried to leave me multiple times but with my mental health being at my worst and I wasn't having any mental health yet I really didn't handle it well. I started a still on going addiction of self harm and my worthless ass threatened to kill myself if they left me.

I feel so so so horrible that I forced this on them. They were practically forced to keep me alive. I wish I could go back and change things. I eventually ended up trying to kill myself and was sent to the hospital as I was kicked from the school. 

I started to get the help I needed but I'm still extremely mentally ill and can't even work normal jobs because of it.

A bit after this I was used by a pedophile I saw as a brother. But. At the time I wanted it because I felt like someone wanted me. This still haunts me

There was a few people who wanted me. But not.All All except one abused me. The one who didn't didn't know the severity of my mental health and dumped me over it.

I've tried dozens of dating apps and nothing. A very few people who to did talk to me all try to abuse and use me since I'm very easily abusable.

I don't even know what a hug feels like. 

Awhile ago I found someone on a Discord venting server who if I must say, is absolutely perfect. She sven accepts all my mental health issues and it doesn't bother her, she even said she'd probably date me.... If she wasn't with her long term boyfriend who she is extremely loyal too. I'm not gonna try and mess that up, he makes her happy. But I honestly think I'd kill myself if I lost her. She's my best friend and the only real reason I'm even alive atm. Because, he'll always be better then me. I'm a worthless piece of shit who always hurts though close to me.

Besides, I'm not even in the same country as her..

I don't even have a SINGLE friend in my city. No one to see it talk too. Dating sites are worthless and I don't go to school so I can't meet anyone there. Not that they would talk to a girl like me.

Everyone hate me. I've struggled my entire life in social situations and couldn't even properly speak till a few years ago. Had speech therapy for like 12 years. I'm fine now though 

But everyone finds me annoying and anyone who tries to get close to me gets hurt. And I don't even notice what I'm doing wrong until it's too late. 

There is one person who likes me but it's a guy, and we have nothing in common.

I've already tried dating since and those don't work for me, there's no where for me to go to meet people. I can't drive, Idk how to ride a bike, I can't even live alone. I'm too fucking worthless I can't even live alone. 

Even if some girl did want me (never gonna happen let's be real. I'm a worthless failure lol.) They'd quickly see I'm mistake that needs to be killed. Besides, why would anyone want me when I can't even take care if myself? I can clean myself and make my food and shit.  But anything adult I struggle horribly or can't even do.

I was thinking about trying to pay people to be my friend but well. No money for such a thing

There is zero reason for someone to like me. Wait no. There is one reason, some one could abuse me horribly and I wouldn't leave them. I rather be abused then be alone

I really want to try and meet new people but Idfk what to do. Humans scare me, I have a HORRIBLE social anxiety disorder

When it comes to humans I actually get to talk to, there my mom, my therapist once a week, and that's it. I rarely talk to my dad and don't really get along with him

I feel like no one even looks at me. Pretends I don't exist.

I feel like all those friends I've hurt would be so happy to see me die. I don't currently have plans on suicide, but the thought of people being happier with me being dead is always there

I might try a dating app again but Idk why I would even bother. No one would want me. If I was prettier maybe, but I'm uglier then a pile of shit. Pretty people always has it easier

If I did try people would just make fun of me for being a failure and for how ugly I am. 

I would buy a professional cuddler for a few hours but again, money. Though I would be too scared to be touched. I've never been held before and I panic when touched as I'm scared if being raped. I may be ugly but I am weak and small. Can't fight back. An easy target. No one would even notice me disappearing

Even if there were girls who'd like a girl like me I don't even know how to find them

At this point no feel dead and extremely depressed. Cutting barely even feels like anything anymore. But I promised my friend I wouldn't kill myself. 

But why? No one will ever love me, I don't want to live when I know I'll die alone without ever even knowing a hug.

I just want to be loved.... It's all I wanted my entire life, but as each day passes it only become more and more clear that I'm going to die alone with no one coming to my funeral. I don't even deserve a funeral anyways

I want to hear someone tell me they loves me even if I have to pay to do so them just once

No one has ever wanted me and never will. I'm a worthless ugly failure.

But I always was confused on why people only ever treated me so lowly. People seem repulsed from me for no reason. I struggled to make friends as a kid alot and people still think I seem weird and I would often be treated like some sort of tapestry hidden behind a curtain.

I know looking for dates at work isn’t the most ideal plan but it’s almost comical how bad my luck is at work	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	16	10	"Like I’ll be minding my own business with no interruptions from managers or anybody. As soon as I start talking with a girl magically a manager pulls up and interrupts shit. Like where tf was your ass at this whole time I was kicking it by myself? And I get it it’s work so there’s not gonna be THAT much time to socialize hence one of the reasons looking for dates at work is a challenge, but I swear to God I feel like the only person getting hoed this hard at work. 

I see other people (both of the opposite sex) having a convo and chilling out in the open with little to no interruptions and actually being able to form bonds and shit yet with me if I’m so much as in the same 10 ft radius of a girl I’m interested in these managers come out of the blue to pull either me or her away to do some other work and I’ll end up not seeing said person again for the rest of the day.

Like goddamn I feel like I can’t catch a break, happened to me at least 3 times this week alone the few times I did get to interact with the women at my job, even happened to me today holy shit. I can see if I was some registered sex offender that somehow got a job there why this would be happening but on everyone I love I’m clean. If I was superstitious I’d think some witchdoctor put some random hex on me causing my luck to be this comically bad, I think I’m starting to even believe that superstition at this point. I hate to rant so much on here but it’s just really annoying and at times even depressing. Like jokes aside this actually has me feeling pretty damn low sometimes. Shit sucks."

A list of what went wrong	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	10	"- Parents overfeeding me making me a fat kid


- Me losing interest in the little sports I did as a kid, making myself even fatter. Fat = unpopular --&gt; no one listens to you --&gt; why would I say anything --&gt; quiet boring guy


- Valuing middle school homework over keeping in touch with primary school friends, making me lose the realest friends I ever had


- Girls in middle school pretending to like me and guys pretending to want to become friends. This one sounds meaningless but I'm convinced this is why I still have bad trust issues and anxiety 10 years later


- Kinda having 'friends' in high school, but they were dicks to me sometimes for basically no reason, so was I sometimes, one day out of the blue they just cut me off which just added to the trust issues 


So going into university I was a mess. I finally got into sports again and lost a lot of weight. I tried to make friends, I wouldn't say it didn't work but they've become acquaintances at best because I'm still not a fun, interesting person to be around. I never got over the middle/high school stuff even if I'm closing in on 24, I know it's pathetic but therapy isn't fixing this. I'm too far gone."	ForeverAlone	2022-06-26T20:50:08.000Z	JimmySaulGene

I feel too uncomfortable with myself and my past to build a bridge with another human ever again.

I don't think that people like me who make the world a worse place due to our cowardly and arrogant nature deserve attention or affection. Yet this is something that I have an unquenchable thirst for. I want attention. I want it so bad. But I want it to feel valid and deserved too.

Someone genuine to talk to. 5 years depressed with no one to talk to	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	14	32	I’m 20 and turning 21 this month. It’s been 5 years depressed, lonely, and friendless. It’s the worst it’s ever been I’ve never felt more depressed and suicidal now. The last 5 years have been miserable. Dropped out of school at 15, friendless as a trauma response I cut everyone off. Lost friends and I have genuinely no  one, on my life… no one. From depression and trauma I’ve got a binge eating disorder and gained weight. I’ve been skinny my entire life I feel fat and disgusting. I feel like no one would ever want to talk to me bc I’m so fat but I see girls 5 times my size with friends and ppl who want to be around them. I’m not even that fat and I feel like a cow. I’m not in college and don’t even have my high school diploma. I thought I’d kill my self a long time ago so I never even tried to get it. Everyday I’m disassociated and feel like life is fake. I’m so suicidal it takes over all my thoughts every single day. I cry everyday uncontrollably and lock myself in my room. I don’t know how my parents still believe in my and support me. I long for just another human to talk with and hug. A shoulder to cry on or someone to care. My 21st birthday spent alone so pathetic I look at my self and genuinely want to hurt myself. Such a failure at something so simple . I tried to make friends on bumble bff. I met some ppl but after a while it becomes tasking to try to seem interesting. Depression has genuinely sucked the life out of me. I’m so boring and robotic. It doesn’t help that I’m nerodivergent I hate myself. I wish I was a normal 20 year old girl In school, doing hobbies, having girlfriends, going out. I don’t care too much about romantic relationships I just want a friend in life. Everyone needs someone every human needs love. And God couldn’t give me that. I pray for the bare minimum and get nothing. I feel cursed . Every time I feel like I’m close to having a normal life I get hit like a truck back to reality. I’m so unlovable. So miserable. I’ve never felt more suicidal in my life. I have a burning feeling all over my body hearing these suicidal thoughts in my head every minute of the day I want to scream out loud.

I miss that now. My wife forces all her responsibility into me and resents me for suggesting she lift a finger. I’m drowning trying to provide for her and her two daughters, who are so spoiled they refuse to use a trash can. They just throw their garbage on the floor. 

Now I’m surrounded by people who use me and hate me. This is a loneliness that’s quiet. And I can’t tell anyone. Once you become a stepparent, you’re not allowed to have feelings anymore. You’re not allowed to say anything bad because “oh the poor kids.” Sorry, I know being a step kid is seriously rough, but being a stepparent is almost equally impossible. Everything I do is just automatically wrong. I’m expected to cook and clean and provide and shut up and fake happiness every second while my “family” treats this like a bed and breakfast.

RANT / With some people you just should never admit you're depressed, ever, because to them you're just being lazy and in need of a buttkick because it's so simple, right	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		53	"I suppose many here will relate. I am severly depressed for a while and went through psychosis (not yet out of it but still, I am better) and suicidality (have yet to fix that) and all I got from my mother when I told her I was depressed was ""maybe in fact you're just being lazy"".

Coming from the person who is literally the source of my depression, of my problems with women, and of my alcoholism ie the main trigger for all my mental health problems, this goes a long way.

I regret to have ever dared to tell her, because I was less suicidal, and here I go again feeling like not only am I fucking retarded to be so ill whereas other guys are actually doing something about their lives, but now every time I don't do something my inner voice is like ""lazy piece of shit""...

Anyways, just to say, some people just can't be talked to about your mental state because well, they just don't get it, even more so when they're literally the cause of your depression. The vast majority of the population just doesn't even acknowledge mental pain is a thing, they just interpret it as a sign of weakness."	depression

So many problems start to finish from living with parasites that have dragged my life to the ground. Wasted my time. I have tried so many things to move out of this mess. Tried so hard. Everything, but stuck in the same place. Tried moving out for one year with no result, even done driving lessons which complete strangers that did fuck all for me. Looked all over for my purpose in life and just have no answer for it all. I don’t want to do anything and I’m not motivated by anything of this world. All I know is I don’t want to be here. I had this imagination of seeing better days, the sunny days and just being in the moment, but those days just never came. I’m 28. I’ve never had a life of my own. Nobody is thoughtful Nobody is on my side. Everyone makes me out to be a villain and barely takes the time to get to know me. And after yesterday. I aint going back to old ways. People talk shit online, people talk shit in real life, I cant get away from it. You know, to think some people I know sit at home all day, get spoonfed like a fucking manbaby when theyre near 40, and somehow have girls at their room (most likely minors) act fake and try to tear me down when they see me doing something great. Thats what all of them do. But I, try so hard, I get out there and make the effort to talk/find people. But nobody talks to each other, nobody cares about each other and everyone is afraid of each other? Why are they afraid to be their authentic selves? I’m starting to lose hope and don’t have the energy no more. Its not about motivation. I’ve always had motivation, but sometimes its about being realistic. I know when im in unjust situations, when im screwed and considering all the health problems i have, especially havent been sleeping for weeks and months, being plagued by stress and thoughts. I cant do it no more. Im a real person. I dont do this for attention. But I do need to speak to those who understand. I cant be in this alone. But sometimes you have to question if you are the problem, considering all the junk on social media these days, and blind hate online. I cannot tolerate any more negativity. But I need something new. I just dont know what it is yet. I would do so much were I not slowed down by harsh weather, health problems and mental stress. You would wonder whats going on, and I definitely am now.

Usually I don't think very much about my past, lots of bad. So I'm just laying down, and flashes of stuff that's happened to me and extreme paranoia set in.

Relapsing after feeling better sucks (Just a vent).	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	It's because I know what it feels like for things to be good, and it's so frustrating that life isn't that way in the present and I'm just so fucking exhausted of trying and trying and trying. I open my heart to the world and the way I fall back in my pit again is so hard and it's just so exhausting to climb back out again. I have no friends to cry to and no money to pull myself out of my current mess. I've been broken up with and I'm too mentally unstable to hold a job that would barely pay for my medication and therapy (I have Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD, severe anxiety and I'm also on the spectrum. I've tried the free therapy services and it's not been helping. Some say my case is too complicated, some just give out anti-depressants without acknowledging the other problems. I need money for better services). This really sucks!!!!! Sorry I'm just venting because I'm exhausted and I just want to be okay again. Not perfect but at least okay enough to push through another battle. Now I'm barely even that. I'm so exhausted and hurt.	depression	2022-07-01T12:45:52.000Z	konbanwanuno

Traumatic experience at college	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		7	"Hi guys,

I'm currently a rising junior in college, and am currently going through a depression and anxiety after a pretty traumatic event that happened about 2 months ago.

I've always been an extroverted person who loved to have fun by being a troll/goofball socially, but preferred to keep a tight group of friends, stayed lowkey, and focusing on my work&amp;self rather than being at huge social events. I never really cared about what people said about me, but this event really changed how I am, and I'm afraid it might change me for ever.

Two months ago, a girl I was dating at the time informed me that her ""best friend"" was spreading quite disgusting rumors about me and that ""she's been telling me that I should change the way I present myself.""  I was very stressed at the time since I had interviews coming up (actually through the next 3 days), and I just flipped out on her, especially since her friend is as dramatic and gossipy as one could possibly get, who believes saying ""ew"" to people's looks is okay, but being told ""check yourself"" is body shaming (lmao).

After a few arguments (which I later found out that her friends were also listening to the convo), I guess she just got her feelings hurt and one-sidedly and called quits on the relationship. After, I went to talk to some of my ""friends"" about the incident, and it turns out that those 2 went up to all the people they pretty much know, and spread the rumors about how I treated her like dogshit literally because of 1 fight.

This was my first time feeling so betrayed by a close (probably the closest person I had) on campus, and the fact that they were running around crying and spreading about the whole thing, and the people who I considered ""friends"" to be shit-talking me really disgusted me (It's like they believe I dropped a f-bomb out of nowhere in clear blue sky). Like I really wish that those girls would just go and fucking kill themselves.

But, it was also a very traumatic event for me since these were the first group of people I met, who I communicated with on daily basis. I'm suffering from depression &amp; anxiety now, worry about the slightest things that I never worried about, and still haunted by these nightmares after the school has now been over for 2 months, which prevents me from being a joking-around goofball and love spending time with people, but rather having a hard time living in the moment.

I really don't want to go back to school since I have to see their disgusting faces again, and I feel like going back could just make me even more depressed. But at the same time, I feel awful about myself because I'm worried about a bunch of unimportant people talking about me, and the fact that I dated a girl like that makes me feel even more disgusted about myself.

I need some help and advice and was wondering if I could get some..."	depression		
Fed up	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"I’ve got depression anxiety and fibromyalgia so my whole life seems just be feeling anxious upset suicidal and in constant pain that only get worse with panic attacks.

What’s wrong with me	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	0	All of my friends are going out with girls but all my life all the girls I’ve liked have disappeared. Im 19 and a virgin and I know I’m ugly but I’m still 6’4 and jacked and funny and I’m a real gangster. I don’t understand what girls are put off by. It makes me so sad when I see happy couples and it makes me violent when my friends talk about sex. Im genuinely confused on why I’m always so alone and why no girl has ever shown any interest in me. Im shy and reserved but only because no one has ever shown interest in me. I used to be very extroverted and have lots of friends. I used to be the class clown but these failed attempts at attracting women have left me so nervous that nowadays I can barely look a pretty girl in the eyes. My family pressure me into finding a date, I get embarrassed when people ask about my love life considering I’m 19 and have never kissed a girl in my life. This makes me sad then sadder. Then I get angry and angrier. Then I fall back into the comforting arms of Xanax and weed. Wtf is wrong with me. I fucking hate seeing happy couples.

Eating a good meal to distract me from the thought of suicide.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		8	"Currently at a local burger joint in my area. I had a big, chain-reaction argument with my family because I (22F) was woken up by my mom while sick ( sore throat) and fatigued. I snapped at her, to which in turn, she screamed and broke some things in the kitchen, and then proceeded to yell at my sibling.

I’ve been struggling with depression for a month. It’s been horrid. I’ve self harmed and have had a bad time taking care of myself if I’m not doing school, work, and trying to relax with my bf or myself.

I’ve been failing at doing the small things, such as laundry, showering, cleaning my room. I just feel like I can’t do certain things.
My sleep schedule is also messed up.

So, everyone was arguing. I decided I wanted to leave for some fresh air. My mother threatened to not let me go on a weekend trip with my boyfriend, and kept asking why I was “acting this way” and if I got this upset at my boyfriend if he woke me up. He doesn’t. He lets me rest. He knows how tired I’ve been.

I shouted a “fuck you” because why would she make matters worse in trying to control me? Before this, she apologized for the first time she had woken me up and even offered to help me with my clothes. But then said she would put the clothes back in my room and asked if I wanted to live like a pig with dirty clothes in my room. I don’t.

I don’t want to live like this. Everything feels so wrong. I keep upsetting my family. I keep becoming irritated due to my depression and anxiety. I’m attending therapy, and going to be taking some supplements because I’m having issues with SSRI’s, and….I don’t have anyone.

I ran, per say? Because I have no one. My emotionally abusive father…can’t see him. My mother who did all that despite being concerned for me…can’t see her. My sibling who is always on edge and I can’t speak to… can’t see them.

My boyfriend is out of town. My friends are busy, and I don’t want to burden anyone else.

So it’s just me. And this burger. And I really don’t want to finish it because I’m afraid of going home.

What sucks too is I have an exam to take tomorrow and I’m scared that I’ll be too tired during exam time. 

I just want to take my time here. Everything feels overwhelming. I know it’s my fault for not doing a months worth of laundry because I’m mourning the relationship I had with my dad, because I am in denial of him being abusive. My mom said I’m not the only one with issues. I know. I know. I should do better. I’m so sorry that I can’t.

Maybe when I don’t have work or school next month, things can get better. But I feel so hopeless and pathetic. I don’t have a lot of money—I really suck at that.

I just want to get better someday but today, I don’t feel like it’s close at all. Progress feels far and I feel like I’m going backwards each day."	depression		
Need Advice: Severe depressive phase/burnout	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	2	"Hi fellow redditors,

I'm struggeling with a severe depressive phase and I'm looking for advice from somebody who can relate.

Since Monday I'm struggeling to get out of bed.
I'm feeling exhausted, but i struggle to sleep since my mind is racing back and forth. 
I work in a really demanding job which has been extreme since a couple of months now, so i called in sick.
Haven't been to a doctor on monday. 
In the evening my girlfriend came over and also noticed that something was wrong, but i couldn't tell her about my depression. But she obviously noticed that something was wrong, ended up crying that night since she said something very loving to me. 


The last days have been the same, i always wanted to get up, but couldn't.
Now today I called my Girlfriend and came clean, why we havent seen each other this week.
Also called my mum and my boss and told them that im mentally and physically exhausted to the point where i don't know what to do anymore. 

My girlfriend has been very understanding and gave me a counseling adress where i applied for help.
My boss has also been very understanding and called me off work next week aswell and told me not to worry about not beeing at a doctor for the sick permit. 
I cant believe how much pressure just fell from my heart.

I don't know if this is burnout or depression and i understand that from case to case this varies a lot.

I believe i now took the right steps to go in a positive direction again.
But i wonder about experiences in regards to recovery.

How long did it last?
Was full recovery possible?

Let’s talk “depression”	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	2	I’m 43, Male, married, with a 13 yo daughter.  I’m ugly inside and out.  I have over $300k in debt that can’t be discharged in bankruptcy or forgiven.  I began a new career 5 years ago that turned out to be a flop.  I don’t own a home, can’t afford rent, fight off creditors 10 times a day, and my bank account is negative.  The tension in my house is so thick you can’t see, you can’t breathe, and you can’t think.  My wife and I are strangers and our daughter hates us.  I wake up every morning (if I ever sleep at all) mad because I woke up.  I have no friends, no future, and soon no home.  My truck will be repo’d any minute now.  I cry when I look in the mirror, I honestly do.  Every day.  I avoid people because I have nothing to say.  My life is nothing but a long, slow, painful, miserable, lonely death that is taking its time.  I’d end it with a .44 magnum but with my luck I wouldn’t die and I would just be paralyzed.

Guilty and ashamed	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		8	I feel guilty and ashamed that I am depressed. I have never experienced anything traumatic, haven’t had any horrible things happen to me. Yet I’m depressed. I have a supportive partner and a job that I enjoy. Yet I’m depressed. All the things I dislike about myself (unmotivated, lazy, my physical appearance, lack of discipline when it comes to almost everything) are my own fault. I work 3 12s a week, plenty of free time to exercise, clean, enjoy hobbies. I have no excuse for not caring about myself. I want to be mad, I want to be angry but there’s nobody to be mad at except myself. So many people have it much worse and I am depressed. I want to scream at someone, I want something or someone to blame for how I feel but it’s just me.	depression

i don’t know what to fucking do anymore.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		5	so before you say anything, no i am not going to ✨commit✨ i just don’t know what to do anymore and my therapist is on vacation until the 14th of july. basically my brother is an untreated depressant and refuses to do therapy and take prescriptions. my mom and i have been trying to get him to do this for months but nothing works. we are both 17 and have our licenses. he has a car and 2 motorcycles and i have nothing. my step dad gave him the car for no reason and he got the first motorcycle for also no reason and then realized it was illegal to ride so he got another one for his birthday. both were very expensive. recently he has been treating my mom like absolute shit. my dad is no help and neither is my step dad. both of them come to me when they fight and they don’t know what to do. as you can probably guess it puts a lot of weight on my plate. my mom has been complaining for months about him and my brother has been complaining for months about her. i know who the problem is and what the issue is. my brother thinks he can do whatever he wants no matter who tells him no or yes. he doesn’t give 2 shits about anyone else but himself. *exactly like my father*. today around 6:30pm i told my mom about how he said he would only be on a bike ride for 1 hour but then it turned into 3 and my mom didn’t realize because she was asleep. my mom and i went to go get dinner and she called him on the way home asking why he said it would only take 1 hour but then turned into 2 (i didn’t correct her). he snapped back at her like a slap bracelet. he said she was giving him a hard time and yelling at him and making his life harder when she’s just trying to be a mother. they argued for about 30 minutes after 7. i finally said i was going up to bed but went into my brothers room instead. i handed him his ass. at first he was smirking because he didn’t think i was serious but then he finally realized i was serious. he is the one who is making a big deal out of nothing with my mom. most of the time i take her side because i’m a bystander and can see things from my own point of view. other times i take his side because he raises some good points. i told him everything that was on my mind and that i was sick of hearing fighting every day. it wasn’t just affecting them it was affecting me too which made me sound like i was trying to make everything about myself in the situation. i didn’t mean to yell at my brother for as long as i did it just happened. at one point i could tell he finally understood what i was saying and that it actually sunk in. i have been protecting his ass for MONTHS and i’m done. i cant take it anymore. i cant take lying to my mom anymore about what he’s doing and where he is. i cant take my mom coming to me when it comes to her problems with him anymore. i didn’t know what to do so i exploded. it ended with me chucking my phone at the ground to show him how serious and angry i was. it worked for the most part but then i chucked my phone at his bed and it hit his knee. i felt horrible but then he held that against me when my mom came in after hearing the loud phone chucking sound. i finally told her everything too and i ended up screaming. like literally screaming. not just yelling words but literally screaming. everyone told me to go to my room to calm down and i know this may be tmi but i went to the bathroom to poop instead and i bit my arm really hard. this is probably about 45 minutes later and it still hurts. would not recommend. i am now in my room and took my drugs but am going to stay up until 3 am to watch the last 2 episodes of stranger things. i’ve had it in my calendar since the 27th of may so i’m not going to give up that because i’m depressed. i just needed a place to rant where no one knows who i am so thank you if you read all the way through.	depression

how do i shower without procrastinating?????	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	1	"(i don't have diagnosed depression but i suspect i have it and my parents don't really know I'm struggling)
so like i HATE showering. i always procrastinate showering so my mom set an alarm at 6pm that reminds me to shower. at first it worked okay but now 6pm is the time i hate the most and i get sadder and sadder when it approaches 6pm. and still i always procrastinate until my mom comes back or she almost comes back and i know she's gonna yell at me again if i don't go. i have to shower everyday, she makes me do it, but I'd do anything to not go out for one day so that i don't have to wash my hair, although that's almost impossible because of school and at weekends if i make my parents stay at home all because of me I'd definitely get yelled at, silent treatment and they'd blame everything on me. (i don't have trouble going to school though, in fact i find it better than my house - at least no one is there to criticize me 24/7 and i get to see my supportive friends that some of them are going through the same thing as me.)

after a lot of research i think i probably hate showering so much because i always lose myself while showering - i could sing like I'm having a concert once i step in and 15 mins fly away. then the moment of realization comes and i quickly shower. while i dress up i lose myself AGAIN and that's how i spent &gt;30 mins showering. after that my parents will always yell at me and quite a lot of times they even threatened me that if i don't stop showering so long they won't let me shower again, or no hot water for me anymore. the worst part is because I'm in such a hurry (like 5 mins for actually showering) i always still have flakes on my hair (dandruff? dry scalp? i don't know. all i know is that i get yelled at and criticized by my mom for it and that it's embarrassing af) and i don't have time to moisturize so i barely have days when my eczema doesn't itch, not to mention that i think I'm anorexic as well, I'm underweight and warm water is too cold for me so the water i use is always really hot which makes my eczema worse. maybe because i get yelled at and criticized after showering all the time i hate it??? someone help, I'm tired of getting yelled at because of it everyday."	depression	2022-07-01T10:14:24.000Z	lunanightskiess
Bi-Polar, Anxiety, and Depression = No will to live. . .	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"Hi everyone, okay so a little back story:  


I was diagnosed with Bi-polar Disorder and Anxiety back in 2014 after ending up in hospital due to a failed suicide attempt. I was on medication and seeing a psychiatrist  for the depression and for the anxiety but due to the nature and of life was forced to drop all my meds back in 2018. The meds kept me neutral for the most part so I guess it was better then the depression. And I guess being raised by a narcissist (which I only figured out there is such a thing recently) did not help much either  


I have been going through a lot the last 3/4 years and I have lately just been feeling extremely depressed and suicidal. I have no one to reach out too so that is why I am here. I cannot unfortunately afford to see a specialist and unfortunately all free services in our country is about as useless as a rock.   


I am mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually just exhausted. I am always tired, and do not really want to do anything. Everything I have once enjoyed is now a complete chore. Currently also struggling a bit with who I am as a person, my sense of self,  and what I need to do and how to get there.   


I am tired of surviving on a day to day basis. I would like to live. Surely this is not what life was meant to be like I mean really, because if this is it I do not want it anymore. I drink every single day just to make the voices quiet and have some form of ""peace"".   


I honestly do not know where to go and what to do anymore and seriously driving my car of a bridge is seemingly more and more inviting every single day.   


Anyway, so sorry for the rant (if anyone reads this)...  


DMs welcome (forgive me if I take long to reply) my motivation these days are pretty much gone."	depression	2022-07-01T10:05:52.000Z	SoulGriever32

I'm too timid, too insecure, too introverted. I have been rejected my entire life. Always in the same ways. Some people point out my low self-esteem and say I need to be more confident, but that feels like lying to myself. I can't do it.

I am always nice to other regardless because I know how it feels to be treated poorly. Maybe I should stop doing that, but I can't. All this rejection made me a people pleaser with terrible social anxiety.

Friday’s Depression Session hit a lot earlier today :(	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		2	"Not having a cry for attention or wanting a response, just maybe saying these “out loud” might help me.

So was enjoying the day at work, until sometime after lunch when the conversation of the guys working next to me changed to sex stories. While trying to think of lies in case they ask me, i had a think back to my past. I’m a sweet hearted loser, practically virgin (thats why needed lie), lonely, over weight, only had bad relationships, and really have no motivation for the future. Wouldn’t say I’m suicidal, but have once gotten to the point of not wanting to live but didn’t progress further because someone needs to take care of my dog. I’ve just had enough of feeling this way. Health is shit cause dieting not worth the struggle when delicious food is one of my few joys. I pretend that i drink socially for fun but its just to drown the moods. Sometimes when riding my bike I’d either excessively speed or close my eyes and count because its a thrill and death doesn’t terrify me. I’m a bit of a shut in, I don’t want to be but past experiences have really fucked up my ability to trust and opening up honestly. Usually when i get this way i tend to try to persuade sad to anger. But thats just makes it worst, cause then I’d be “shifting to blame” and doesn’t resolve my depression. Because of all this i wanted a knife instead of a paint  brush when it all started at work today. When i got home (hour ago) in my attempt to resolve my mood my thoughts mostly focused around a particular date and wishing it never happened. Sure i met people who i hated a year later and that the neg out weighs the pos since then. However, can’t blame the past, caused id have been lonely without experience and you can only take things as a learning curve to build character (hate that saying but its true). So, I’m going to try and not be such a baby, get over it and stop saying no to things. I can’t just keep repeating the same behaviour thats causing my depression or i’ll go insane ."	depression

I understand why my uncle took his life	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		168	"He was an estranged hermit that simply worked and went home AFAIK. He got laid off from his job over some BS, then hung himself in a closet 2 weeks later. This was 10 years ago, he was 55.

&amp;#x200B;

He didn't have a wife, kids, cat, dog. He didn't do drugs or drink heavily.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't depression that killed him IMO, it was emptiness. And when he lost his job- all he had, the emptiness came to a head. How quiet his apartment must have been those final weeks. And that is how I am feeling... not necessarily sad, just so desperately alone, and can't envisage my circumstances changing any time soon. Money would make a difference but I'm 32 and have had 20 different jobs over the years, I'm just not enthusiastic enough to look for another minimum wage job. So I leech off my parents for the time-being. I feel guilt about this, and also shame.

&amp;#x200B;

I silently mutter that I should just kms multiple times every day. The only pragmatic reason I have to live on is maybe one day I'll summon the motivation to publish my joke book... but that's been on hold 5 years already. I know its time to buck up and make a change before the quicksand takes me, I'm submerged to the neck, and the longer I idle the deeper I go."	depression		
The disappointing cycle of me :/	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		3	"I feel so terrible right now. For the past 5 years I've told myself that my grades are gonna get better. That it's better than before and then high school hit me. 18, going on 19, subjects is too much for me earlier i lied and told my mom that i did my portfolio for clothing and textlies when i didn't submit it and i don't check the platform often so i have a big fat 0%. Most of my classes i have a D or a C and it's getting worse and worse. I have zero motivation for school and it's getting worse. Maths is hard. English is complicated. All three sciences are destroying every fiber within my soul. Music i hate. Clothing and textiles destroyed my interest for sowing and every single class sucks so bad. Then soon ill be doing business studies which will be hard.
This is why i read over 5 hours a day. I don't go anywhere as there isn't anywhere to go. I don't feel any motivation to do anything besides read and write. I feel like a blob taking up space i don't like it here i don't like it when i go to school to learn.
Its killing me inside but i feel bad for going in school and just laugh and talk with my friends as if nothings wrong. I hate my school so bad. I just wanna stop existing for a moment or have my memories wiped and start a new life.
I hate it when i feel like this. I feel like my grandmother and aunt would be ashamed in me when I know they they won't and they're dead. I'm disappointed that my habits won't break.

Using mocks for Python testing	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	40	113	"Hi all!

I've three videos about using mocks in Python testing, and using of unittest.mock package.  


1. Introduction to Python Mocks:  
[https://youtu.be/xT4SV7AH3G8](https://youtu.be/xT4SV7AH3G8)

2. How to mock Python exceptions:  
[https://youtu.be/RqR0AvEujrU](https://youtu.be/RqR0AvEujrU)

3. How to use Responses library to test functionality based on Requests library:  
[https://youtu.be/RNVspDHVIA0](https://youtu.be/RNVspDHVIA0)

&amp;#x200B;

Why Python mocks are important:

* Mocks eliminate dependency on network, database calls, calls to OS (it will speed testing)
* we get isolated unit tests,
* we can test methods that have no return value
* reduce test complexity. We don't have to write complex logic to handle behavior of methods under tests.
* don't have to wait to implement other methods.

The two features I am personally looking forward to are: (1) auto TLS certificates for localhost dev, and (2) an integrated HTTP/3 server.

To get a localhost certificate, you will need [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) or [trustme](https://github.com/python-trio/trustme) installed.

    $ sanic path.to.server:app --auto-tls --debug

To run an HTTP/3 server, you need to install [aioquic](https://github.com/aiortc/%60aioquic%60). Then you can run it along-side HTTP/1.1 like this:

    $ sanic path.to.server:app --http=3 --http=1

The HTTP/3 implementation is still a work in progress. But in the wake of [RFC 9114](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html), it is exciting to see this next chapter of the web unfold."	Python	2022-06-30T12:22:24.000Z	admhpkns

The grid´s units have to be specific as there is a part that uses distance between two points but Im already re writing it to work with different grids.

[ Design / Architecture ] Applying dependency inversion, Flask vs Django (from Cosmic book)	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	2	"In [chapter 2 of the Cosmic book](https://github.com/cosmicpython/book/blob/master/chapter_02_repository.asciidoc), they talk about using Flask + SQLAlchemy in classic/imperative mode to enable the application of the dependency inversion principle (DIP). 

Some excerpts:

- (in reference to using SQLAlchemy declarative mode, no DIP) *”The point is the same—​our model classes inherit directly from ORM classes, so our model depends on the ORM. We want it to be the other way around.”*

- (regarding SQLAlchemy classical/imperative mode, DIP unlocked) *”The ORM imports (or ""depends on"" or ""knows about"") the domain model, and not the other way around.”*

The idea being, inverting the dependency allows independent testing, as the domain model/business logic knows nothing about the ORM. The ORM objects are not the domain/business objects. 

They mention Django ORM has no imperative mode, so essentially it’s difficult or impossible to get the same dependency inversion.

My question is:

- **What if you’re using Django rest framework to serve an API or microservice?**

With DRF (at least potentially), the domain model / business logic doesn’t necessarily need to know the API is using DRF. So it seems like this should be an okay design/architecture choice? Or no?"	Python	2022-06-29T01:27:28.000Z	PlausibleNinja

Unity, a game development tools provider, laid off hundreds, Protocol reports. The company employed as many as 3,300 as of June 2020, the year it went public, but its stock price has fallen more than 40% since.

How To Get Over Blowing an Live Coding Problem?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	63	94	"I completely blew a live coding interview yesterday and it’s was humiliating 

I’ll preface by saying originally the company gave me a take home test which I did not do well on. I failed 3/4 of questions and didn’t even answer the 5th cause something else wrong, but I wrote how I would’ve did it. 

So when I got the next interview I was really surprised. I got asked a bunch of questions about tool I’ve never used so I couldn’t answer. Then I got to a live coding test which was using python to parse some medical data. For whatever reason my brain just could not do it. I kept writing nested for loops and getting confused and then the people interviewing would step into to help and I’d get more confused. This went on for over an hour. 

Towards the end the guy who would be my boss just started shaking his head and being frustrated. All I could do was laugh cause at the point I knew I blew it. So obviously it ended without me completing it. I just laughed and said sorry fellas I think I just got lost in the sauce or something, and felt pressure from multiple people watching. 

The boss guy said it’s not a no, and he’ll try and figure out something for me. Honestly if they want another round I think there’s something wrong with the company. But I’m still just embarrassed."	cscareerquestions	2022-06-30T16:36:16.000Z	shittyfuckdick

I could use some help and advice, i don't want this to be too much so if i need to take down the post please tell me. 

I graduated college with a CS degree (3.81 GPA it went down from 3.90, ceremony end of july) and i am scared. 

These past couple of years, i felt like i was on autopilot just existing. Last semester we had a graduation project, which i procasinated a lot on i started like 3 weeks before the due date, and it was really bad i had panic attacks and i was constantly crying thinking I won't get it done, i had friends helping me and i did it. After that experience my fears doubled, what if i l'm not good, what if i go to a job and don't know anything or don't know how to solve a problem or how to think about it. This fear is stopping me in my tracks i can't do anything like study or think about the future. I had 2 interviews that didn't go well, sucked at both of them which only fueled my fear. And now i am training as an ERP developer, but i might have another opportunity for training with JS, HTML, CSS, Java... but there's a technical interview and i am panicking... I feel like my brain is foggy and i can't focus, i get frustrated when something doesn't work i just think ""of course i suck"". I talk to my friends and they don't understand why i am having this panic, i mean one of them took a project with laravel and he didn't even know that language! And here i am at 21 years old shaking with just the thought of doing something. 

I know not to compare, but i can't i feel dumb and so behind everyone. I mean people see something in me that i don't see in myself, my professors all think that and my family too. But i feel like i fried my brain these past 2 years and i am trying to regain myself and my brain to start. 

So has anyone felt like this? Any tips on how to deal with this?
And idea how i can get myself to start, how to work on myself and improve? 

I went into CS because i love computers and the idea of creating something out of a few lines of code. I don't want to let myself down or my family, i don't want to waste my potential...

I'm horrible at lying, I look around, scratch something on my body, fiddle my fingers or counter what I said in a previous question."	jobs

Thats why women don't sleep with you. ""oh but that guy is just using you for sex"" well no shit, im using him for sex too.

I did something bad that I now realize was cheating	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	4	"When I was 16/17 I would go online and erp. I realize now that it was wrong to do this is a minor but I’ve made peace with that aspect. 

Heres the thing, I think I may have also done it while I had a gf? Im not entirely sure, ADHD time blindness is weird, but I’m fairly certain the timelines match up. If I did I’m also fairly certain I stopped when I realized what I was doing was cheating. 

To clarify what I was doing, erp is erotic roleplay. The people I would play with never saw me or knew me in any way and visa versa. We played characters via text chats. 

I despise cheaters, but last night at 1 am it came crashing down on me that I guess I technically am one. 

I don’t talk to this person anymore, we broke up amicably at the end of HS. Part of me feels like I should text her and tell her but like we haven’t spoken in like a year now."	offmychest	2022-07-01T13:32:48.000Z	cyoagirlalt
ADHD is debilitating and I'm so tired of people making it seem quirky	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"I know that some people cope with their problems with humour and this has nothing to do with that, but there's so much toxic self-diagnosing that I see on the internet who thinks that ADHD is just something thay makes you distracted and random and I find it so frustrating. 

ADHD can be really debilitating. I got overwhelmed by some inconveniences the other day on my way home the other day and ended up losing something that hardly matters; because once I become overwhelmed I become even more severely disorganized. 

While it hardly mattered it sent me into a spial and I spent days being upset and hating myself for not being able to function like the adult that I am. I WISH I could do basic chores easily, I WISH i could stick to  a routine, I WISH u could remember where I put things. Not being able to do these things make me feel ridiculous and childish and it makes me hate myself. 

So when I see people saying they're ""so ADHD""  cause they get distracted watching videos on their phone instead of getting ready for bed just makes feel so invalidated. I know it's stupid and I should get over it, but it's just been on my mind a lot recently and I just needed to let it out."	offmychest	2022-07-01T13:30:40.000Z	yawaworht9128

i want to move on	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"hello

this is kinda a buzzkill post so yeah might wanna skip

so i (18 m) lost my virginity to this girl (we were both 17 at the time) and it was really great because i had thought that i finally had someone i could be myself with and be intimate.

it was at this time that i was the happiest i had ever been in my life. because shes beautiful and we got along so well together and everything just felt so natural. like drifting along a lazy river.

i felt confident

i quit porn

i was sociable

i had motivation

but um, i fucked up. people (neckbeards) on reddit tell me that im a disgrace to men, my friends (slight douchebags) and other people tell me i didn't do anything that wrong and its not that deep.

basically i told people i had sex with her. and yeah ill be the first to admit it was in a bragging sort of way. but when i said it like that i realised that actually being with her was so much better than bragging about her.

i also told mutual friends of ours to give context, because i wanted to know if it was possible we could have a relationship in the future. i got the same response from everyone, 'she doesn't really want a relationship right now'

in my mind because she never said to keep things between us and because she didn't want a relationship i kinda felt relieved because i guessed she wouldn't have cared that i had told people, not that i ever wanted to hurt her regardless.

anyway. word got around to her, and she was understandably upset. i got home from work to a text.

'im going to murder you'

and my heart sunk to my toes.

i felt so damn sick.

and looking at the texts i sent they were very apologetic but looking back it sort of seemed one note. i definitely rushed to type them without thinking and i think that was a mistake.

looking back on these texts really hurt man. and i also feel like an asshole.

anyway i gave her some time and about five days later i asked if we could talk in person and she didn't want to so i spent some time trying to create the perfect text to send to her.

and in the end it didn't do much

she said that she misses the version of me who wasn't a dickhead.

which is fair enough because i certainly feel like one.

i tried to move on, i turned 18 a couple of weeks after this, and that was alright but i still remember thinking of her.

i tired to distract myself by drinking and relapsing on porn, it sorta worked at the time,

but the thing is i caught covid, badly. and being quarantined all i could think about was how i lost her and how i was the asshole. anyway i get out of quarantine, but a week later i feel this chest pain at work

it doesn't get better the next day. in fact it got really bad

i called an ambulance for myself and was sent to hospital

the ecg read that i was having a heart attack. despite the pain i was feeling it turns out that i had pericarditis from viral infection.

anyway staying in hospital was the worst experience of my life.

not because of the food, not just because of the physical pain

it was because i realised how alone i was.

none of my friends saw me, and the only one in my family who came was my mum, and she could only stay for 15 minutes.

remember how i felt like i was on a lazy river.

when things fell through with us it felt like the lazy river had suddenly opened up into a ravine with a raging rapid, in which i kept my eyes closed. until i went into hospital.

because all i could think about was her. and how i lost her and how none of the people around me make me feel the way i did with her.

i get out of hospital and they discharge me with medication that i have to take for the next 3 months, i also couldn't drink smoke or exercise. i naively thought that this would be easy.

wrong

i became very bored in every aspect of my life. and to fill this boredom all i would do is think and reminisce about her. and id end up missing her a lot.

fast forward a bit to the first time i would go out clubbing.

and i just so happen to run in to her. keep in mind im sober, we have a kinda meaningless talk and i go back to hopelessly dancing. but the thing is, i couldn't stop my eyes from locking onto her i kept thinking about how much i miss her, how much i wanna be with her dancing to whatever crappy 2010 pop hit was on.

but i reminded myself how angry and how done she was with me.

so i retreat to the upstairs of the club which overlooks the mosh and i see her dancing with another guy and despite barely being able to see them in the mass of bodies my eyes are locked. and i see them make out. a wave of jealousy overwhelms me and despite it being hot as balls in there i feel chills run down body.

anyway that was about 2 weeks on the medication. and throughout the next period of time, i would begin to see her in the clubs again and again. and the same guy that she hooked up with, they would end up dating. good for her

but i couldn't be more miserable. i long everyday for her touch to hear her laugh, see her smile.

but now i have to bear witness to everything i want to happen to me, happen to this guy.

she approached me once in the club with her boyfriend standing tentatively to the side and she asked 'how's your heart?'

i replied with 'its fine'

in reality my heart feels like it has been ripped out of ribcage by wolverine, ripped to shreds by a pack of hyenas, driven over with a tractor and set on fire.

all i think about is her.

and believe me i want to get her out of my head but i just cant

almost the entire time of my 4 hour shifts at work is spent thinking about her.

ive become suicidal.

i feel so alone all the time. i feel like an outcast in my friend group, i cant participate in anything they do, ic an't work on myself through exercise. all i can do is think. and everytime i hop on a train of thought it always pulls into the same station, and shes waiting there.

i feel cheated out of a chance to prove myself because i never did.

i feel cheated out of the ability of being able to move on because my fucking heart is inflamed (how appropriate) and cant socialise in the right way. 

i feel like someone is playing a sick joke on me because the amount of times i just happen to see her or her boyfriend is just so unreal and everytime it happens it genuinely ruins my day and makes me feel so shitty.

i feel guilty all the time for how i made you feel and i can't forgive myself.

i hate the person i see in the mirror

i can count 1 and a half happy memories from the past 3 months. and then it goes right back to her.

i just want to move on

i see a counsellor now. i don't think its helping but i don't even know. i feel close to the point of doing something stupid, hurting myself or her boyfriend.

my counsellor says that maybe i should just talk to her, he says nothing may come out of it, she might even yell at me, but it might do something for my mind.

but im scared to do that. i don't know what to say, i don't know how to say it, im scared that it will leave me in a worse position and would make me long for her even more.

and now im venting online to strangers hoping that this will help me move on but it wont i know that in an hours time i will be back to checking her snapscore or tiktok or spotify for some minor change in her life, because i have spent the last four months now thinking purely of her.

July 7 will be three months since i have taken my medication, july 12 is my cardiology appointment, i hope that they tell me i can get back on track with my life after that.

i want to go to the gym, i want to drink and dance the night away.

i just don't want to be miserable anymore

i have a severe allergy	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		2	"I have no history of allergies, never had an allergic reaction. I turned 23 this spring and then out of nowhere I've had hives all over my body 24/7, I've been to the hospital 3 times for anaphylaxis in the last month, and I have no idea what I'm allergic to. I don't want my family to worry about me because god knows they do it often enough but I'm TERRIFIED. That feeling of my throat swelling shut, my vision closing in, that painful tingling in my hands and face and *everywhere* and then just nothing; its awful.

And I could FEEL my blood pressure hit the floor seconds before I hit it too, I told my sister i dont remember because *I* don't want to but oh god I do and it was awful. The nurse kept telling me to try and sit up, move, tell her my name, anything and I just *couldn't*. I kept trying to say anything at all and then she was shaking me awake again. I could hear them talking about how pale and awful I looked for a second before i passed out again and then they were trying to lift me onto the bed and i just couldn't do anything. 

I'm afraid to breathe now because I might feel that awful tightness and if I don't take a breath I wont feel it and god I've never had much of a will to live but I don't want to die either and I'm so scared. I feel like any second i could just fucking die and i dont know WHY.

On one hand I wish the anger would stop, it is like a heavy blanket that makes it hard to breathe, eat or sleep. On the other hand I don’t care anymore. 
For the longest time I fought with ever last bit of energy I had to be seen, heard and not be fucking misunderstood all the time. But it is pointless. People will see and hear what they want and twist your words to fit their reality. I hate them so much I almost have to laugh. 

If this is what life will be like forever then I will give up fighting against it. I officially surrender myself to the pointless bullshit people come up with, I will stop trying to be understood. I am ready for anything now and the only truth that will remain is that I will never forgive.

I’m a loser	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	3	"I have no one to tell this to and saying it out loud to myself isn’t working. I’m just particularly upset about this today and need to rant. 

I am a loser.

I (22f) don’t hang out with anyone anymore. Actually no one. Not friends anyway. I haven’t seen my middle/high school friend group (5 people) in almost a year.. also haven’t spoken with them except when it was their birthdays. The last time I hung out with my childhood bff (separate from the group) was March, before that was November. All I do is go to work and go home. Literally. The only social interaction I get is from my mom, dad, brother sometimes, my bff sometimes, coworkers (all 40+ parents with grandchildren) and employees at the stores I shop at.

I’m currently at the end of my gap year since graduating university before going back to school and having been working full time hours since last August. No vacations, just straight working.  Since then I have alienated myself I think. I sit at home and play sims and watch YouTube in my off time.

I don’t reach out because I’m too scared/ have a fear of them saying no, which I know is my own fault. They haven’t reached out to me either though. They hang out together … but without me. Either in twos or threes but I’m never included. I know this because they post it on their Instagram stories everytime they hang out. I kinda joke with myself everytime and say “thanks for the invite guys.” 

This might be a stupid reason but I think they don’t invite me because I’m not particularly close with anyone in the group anymore. We kinda lost that since graduating high school and then uni. Everyone has someone else you know.. Another reason may be because I don’t drink alcohol. It feels like every time they want to get together they want to get plastered drunk. And if I’m there not drinking anything, I ruin the mood because I’m introverted and not comfortable yelling and jumping and singing like they are when they are drunk. Why can’t we hang out without getting drunk? Getting drunk isn’t the problem, but every time?

Hopefully when I go back to school in September I can make some new friends (not meant to replace the ones I have now) and be social and push myself to hang out with people outside of work and school. 

I’ve also been single since June 2020 and haven’t had any interacting with guys at all since. My mom has been giving subtle hints that she wants me to date. She dated a lot when she was my age and I’ve only had 1 boyfriend. It makes me feel bad that I’m not living my life. I feel like I’m behind. I’m missing out. 

I understand that I can fix the problem I’m in … it’s  just really fucking hard to put myself out and the strike up conversations or to join clubs. I struggle even going out for walks by myself sometimes.

Something is wrong with me. I didn’t do anything to them as far as I know.. maybe they think I’m angry at them or don’t want to see them. Anyway..

Sorry for the novel.. I just wanted to say all this to someone."	offmychest	2022-07-01T13:45:36.000Z	AmI--Stoopis

I got invited to 2 different interviews in fashion retail, one at Superdry the other at Hollister. Hollister is for stock associate, Superdry for sales. Either would be my first job in retail. I just need something to last me through college, or at least the break.

I’m not sure if it’ll be a group interview, but I’m wondering is there any advice to help during these interviews? I’ve read posts saying “looks matters”. I’m not sure how much truth there is too that, as I wouldn’t consider myself ugly, but I’m not what would typically be considered “good looking”. I plan to dress business casual but add a little of my own flair.

So, uh. I had a friend when I was like in fourth grade, she was the only person that would hang out with me since I was shy and didnt like talking to people much. Even if she was my friend, I didnt really like her.. She was manipulative, I always had to do what she wanted, or either she would take offense and talk shit about me to her friends, I really didnt like conflicts so I just shut up and did what she wanted. I always apologized, for every little thing, and 90% of the time it wasnt my fault. She had a bad day? I comforted her for hours. She would always vent to me about her problems, and then get mad at me. I stayed for her till 4am just so I could text with her. She would get mad at me for EVERY LITTLE thing in her life, it was always somehow my fault. I always told myself ,,Just a few more years and I'll leave her when I'll go to liceum after 8th grade'' (Liceum is like highschool) well I couldn't take it anymore so I just changed schools after 5th grade, I didnt talk with her about how I felt, I just left and blocked her everywhere. I ran away.

I also had a childhood friend, our moms knew each other so we were friends. We went to different school but we met pretty often. Our contact broke off after I became friends with that
girl ^, but after I changed schools we started hanging out again. At first it was like always, but then he started avoiding me (like in january this year) and would hang out with me only if his other friends werent available. He didnt answer my texts, and then text me if I wanna hang out even tho when I wanted he ignored me. Even if we finally go out he would bring 2-3 of other people from his school and pretty much just ignore me. I got sick of it after some months so I simply blocked him. Again, I didnt even try to solve our problem. I just left him. 

In my new school I dont have any friends, like no one. I ALWAYS sit alone, I dont have a person to even say stupid hello to. In home I just play games, I rarely go out, just to school, and its summer now so I dont go out at all. And I dont even try to make friends, I never tried. I let things be from the start, after summer Im going to 8th grade and I know things are gonna be the same. I dont want to change schools again so I just let things be. I guess I may have anxiety, my teacher wanted me to go to school psyhologist (or whatever its called, sorry I dont speak english) but I refused to and I dont try to change things at all."	offmychest		
I don’t agree with my therapist’s opinion	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"I spoke to my therapist about a complicated situation where a friend abandoned our friendship at the worst time of my life. The friend has depression so my therapist kept emphasizing how depressed people can’t function while they’re going through an episode. I feel like this completely simplifies our situation. It makes me feel like my therapist thinks it’s alright for my friend to treat me poorly just because he has depression. I get that maybe the moment that bad stuff was going on with my life was the same moment he went through a struggle, but he has since come out of that and never reached out to me again.

In my opinion it’s not ok for my friend to treat me like shit just because he has depression. I went through depression myself and I didn’t treat people like shit. I just can’t get on board with my therapist’s assessment of this situation. After I provided more context it feels like she gave ok advice but still sorta failed to grasp the entire situation. Other than this she’s been a good therapist when we discussed other issues but this is very annoying to me."	offmychest		
I have no interest in dating black men.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		3	"I really need to get this off my chest. This past year, I've  felt ridiculed, belittled and abandoned by black men. I'm done, because it's not worth it to continue providing for a community that has no interest in protecting me, growing with me, or thriving.

Social media has definitely been a big eye opener for me. I always thought it was me, that something was wrong with me that caused black men to treat me so horribly. And maybe there is, I'm not saying I'm perfect, but the amount of black women going through the same bullshit over and over again is sickening.

Black men do not care about black women. They like our bodies, they like the children we give them, but they have no respect for our lives, our bodies, and our time. 

And what makes it so sad, is that other races can see how horrible we're being treated but we can't. Men from other races acknowledge that black women are more driven and more successful then black men, but we still get treated like we're less than dirt.

The final straw was when that man forced a woman to  walk home because she wouldn't sleep with him. He took her on a date, a date she got an Uber to and paid for, but because she wouldn't sleep with her, he canceled the Uber he bought for her. She had to find a ride alone, at night, after drinking.

It was made worse when the men in the comments called her a gold digger because she didn't want to fuck a stranger. In other communities, men do not act like this. Sure, there's always one random guy who thinks he can treat women this way, but at least other men around them correct them. 

With black men, not only is it acceptable for men to treat us this way, but if we speak out against them, we're shunned, our accomplishments are belittled and we're called so many horrible things.

I'm okay if I never end up with a man. Honestly, I would prefer to be alone and continue with my career than settle with a man, birth children for him, and be left abandoned by him and laughed at by his friends.

Call me bitter, that's fine. I am bitter. I'm angry. I'm hurt. But I'm done rejecting the advances of other men to try and uphold this fantastical idea of creating a black household with a man who secretly hates me."	offmychest		
This month has S U C K E D	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		3	"Throwaway account because I know people who use this app. 

I don't even know why I'm bothering to write this. Just to get the words out I guess, and see if anyone can help surmount this overwhelmed feeling. But, fuck me, I can't catch any goddamn breaks. Just one shitty thing after another. 

The month *started out* with my mother getting a positive screening for lung cancer, y'know, the one that has a barely 50% survival rate five years after treatment. This has come after her smoking for the better part of 50 years, and I'm more upset than anything else at all the times I tried to get her to quit and how maybe that could've prevented this if she only stuck with it. I bargained with her, bought her vapes, even paid for her Chantix once, but she either conveniently lost it or forgot or some other excuse. She's tried to quit numerous times but keeps going back. 
Now that she has cancer, it's almost silly she's trying to quit now, as if that'll make everything better. Just doing too little, too late. Finding out a loved one has cancer is always an emotional roller coaster, but coming to terms with her mortality (And my own) and all the things that come with cancer treatment has been hard to accept, to say the least. It doesn't even seem like she wants to fight sometimes. That alone is really hard to stay positive about. I keep trying, but I don't even know what to say to her. I'm completely powerless to change anything and I hate it. 

Like a week after that, my great uncle passed away. It wasn't like it was unexpected because he was 95 and his health had been declining for a while, but he was my grandfather's brother. I never knew him because he died when I was really young, so he was my only connection to that past, so now that's been taken from me. 

I found out soon after that, my niece and nephew's mother *also* tested positive for cancer. I don't have a lot more information than that because I haven't talked to her, but I feel so bad for her kids. They've already lost so much. Their father, my cousin, was killed in a car accident before their sixth birthday, they've lost one of their uncles to drugs, their grandfather died several years back, and every man who's been a father figure has walked out on them. Now, their mother who's already paralyzed from the waist down and wheelchair bound, has another thing to keep her down. 

It was my birthday a week ago. Half the people in my own family forgot. None of my online friends said anything. With all the shit that already happened, I didn't even feel like celebrating. Certainly far from the best birthday I've ever had. 

Two days after that, I took my seven year old dog to the vet because she's been acting strange. She walks around the house aimlessly and stares at walls, and randomly will pee or poop on the carpet when this dog would sooner hold it for a week before. 
I spent half of my only day off during the week and over $500 at the vet running tests, only for them to tell me they had no idea what was wrong with her, except maybe a really bad infection. I found out yesterday when she went into a violent seizure that it's either epilepsy and she probably won't live past eight, or it's a brain tumor and her days are numbered even lower than that. 

I can feel myself just shutting down because of how much everything has been weighing on me. And that's only causing more problems because I'm talking to people less and less. I mean, even my girlfriend is pissed at me for basically falling off the grid. At least we've talked about it since and she's been understanding enough. 

And as a little more insult to injury, I'm in the middle of the worst poison ivy rash of my life and my skin is on fire constantly. 

Do you ever just wish you were someone else? Because I do. I can't deal with all this coming at me right now. Maybe one thing at a time might have been easier, but it feels like everything is just crashing down around me."	offmychest		
Tried venting a frustrating situation to a group of peers only to have multiple people criticize the way I manage my own business	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"Some guy repeatedly called our office making a completely ridiculous demand. My employee handled the situation with grace, but he did keep her on the phone for a full hour and wasted our time. I wrote a post about it in a peer group with the point being this guy is ridiculous. I got more people commenting about how I shouldn’t have allowed him to waste so much of our time than people saying that guy’s demands made no sense.

I found myself having to stand up for my employee who had to deal with this jerk while my hands were tied doing other things. She could not leave without saying unprofessional things, which she did not do because she knows to maintain our image. If it was me on the phone I would’ve just told him to get lost because heck, I’m the boss. No one’s going to fire me so I don’t give a fuck and I’ll do the dirty work. Complaints against an employee I have to do something about, but no jerk customer’s going to complain about me to me and expect stuff to change.

Anyway my point is my peers kept telling me this guy isn’t worth the time, I need to train my employee better, or or prioritize differently. I initially just politely explained more details but it got to the point where they’re focusing more on what they think I’m doing wrong (like letting someone waste our time, and not training my employee better) rather than agreeing that this is a situation where the guy was nuts. I got tired of reading these comments that made me feel obligated to stand up for my employee who did nothing wrong.

I found out my father molested my sister (and most likely me) as a child yesterday. I don't know what to do.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		2	"Context: I am a female young adult. My family dynamic has always been chaotic and horrible, particularly due to my father and his side of the family. Though I think they are horrible people, I also just think they are severely mentally unstable/ill and are unaware of their behavior and/or refuse to get professional help. This behavior and trauma that it's inflicted upon the rest of my family is very apparent and already haunts me daily.

I have 3 siblings. One of whom is also female. all 3 are adults with their own families and lives. My mom and my dad finally got divorced recently, and i moved out with my mom. My father offered my sister to move in with him after me and my mother moved out. My sister called my mom about it in shock and said my father also *apologized* to her. This gutted my mom as she had not gotten a single apology from my father in all the years of abuse she had suffered, so she hung up mid-call. The two have been distance since. 

Yesterday: I went out with my sister to catch-up and the topic of my mother came up. My sister revealed that my dad admitted to molesting her in her sleep as a child, and that's what he had apologized for. My mom hung up before my sister could even finish that part. He also admitted that he has had a ""fetish"" for young girls. I instantly started crying. She does not want me to tell my mother despite my pleas, as she wants nothing to do with her. When trying to convince my mom to just *at least talk to my sister to see how she's doing* she refused and also said she wanted nothing to do with my sister. And i know if i told her outright, her reaction would be awful and my family would instantly fall apart (more than it already has).

I do not remember most of my childhood bc my brain prevents me from doing so. I have a lot of troubling memories flash through my mind occasionally but have never been able to dig further, and i trust it's because my brain does not want me to. I do remember in my early to late teens coming home to bed looking slept in, clothes rummaged through, and TV being used. I found out at that time it was my dad. I yelled at him about it bc I thought it was strange, but now looking back i fear that that + my troubling repressed memories involve my dad and his sick pedophilia.

I've been extremely depressed and suicidal. All i've been thinking about is how my own father violated my sister and probably me. Even if not me, the notion that he might've thought about the idea enough to sleep in my room and go through my clothes horrifies me. I haven't been able to tell anybody, as the ramifications could worsen my own mental state and further ruin the mental state of my family + cause a domino effect of awful events. 

I want justice for my sister. I feel like my mom has the right to know. But they hate each other too much for the outcome to be positive. I never want to see my dad again. I cannot afford a therapist. I just really want to die. 

Some details have been omitted that make the situation much worse for me, but i'm afraid to get anymore specific in case this post receives more attention than anticipated."	offmychest		
numbness ?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"I feel like I'm just very much immune to everyone's thoughts and opinions about me and I hate it. Like, if someone pinpoints anything about my appearance I just let it slide. I hate that I don't say anything just so I can maintain peace in the situation. I feel like I'm so mentally and emotionally exhausted that literally just don't care about anything anymore. I don't care about how I look, how I smell, how my grades are. I'm just living at this point. I don't even know how I look anymore. 

I feel like I'm never ever going to feel pretty. Most compliments feel shallow. The amount of insults that I've got about my appearance as a kid for being a brown girl in a majority white populated school are probably the reason I feel this way. It's just so exhausting to just never feel confident in yourself.

Someone confessed their feelings to me and I was just in utter disbelief that anyone would even see me in such way. I genuinely don't see what they saw in me. I'm just extremely unattractive and irritating. There's nothing interesting to me. I'm just a teenager who stays home all day because they have no energy to even get out of bed.

I'm so afraid of the future too , like I know im not getting anywhere because I literally have no energy or motivation left in me. My parents expect so much from me and here I am failing every single obstacle life shoves at me. The fact that everyone around me has had a major change in their life and here I am doing absolutely nothing is just crushing me."	offmychest

My (15f) friends (14~15 years old) at school act way too spoiled and I am taking it way too hard	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		6	I am on break and I can relax and detach from school (for now) but holy cow this semester has been the absolute worst. The people I consider friends (now I’m not so sure) have been absolutely horrible to the teachers nearly every single day, and they act as if they aren’t doing anything wrong. Also, they never turn in any work knowing that the school administration cannot fail them (legal mandate). I have only recently been allowed back to in-person school by my parents because of their COVID paranoia so I’ve been playing catch-up and haven’t had much time for fun and hanging out. I have found myself banding together with the quieter kids, while distancing myself from the girls I have been friends with since kindergarten. They are not the people I once knew before 2020. I am so lost with everything and to be alone makes it worse.	offmychest		
I dread my birthday	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		3	My family never celebrated birthdays before. Birthdays were never forgotten though, we usually baked a cake, had some, and then went on about our day like it was any other. I know my family loves me, and it’s not even about gifts, I just wanted to have a birthday party like everyone else I knew. I brought up the idea a few times but inevitably a party never happened so after the second year I stopped bringing up the idea and I just became content with the cake and having family around. As years went by it was the same thing minus the cake since I became a teen. Now as a soon to be 26 year old male I become sad this time of year because I know my birthday will come and go just like every other day this month and I just want it to be special for once. I feel selfish and dumb for thinking so and the chances of this year being any different are looking slim since my ex and I broke up. I always tried to make my own birthday special by doing whatever I wanted but since last year I don’t have the energy to try anymore so I ended up asking my employer for an extra shift	offmychest

I didn't cry	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		2	"4 years ago I picked her up when she was at her worst and slowly helped her build herself up again. I sat through some dark nights with her, checking in to make sure she was still breathing. I listened to her scream cry in my ear. Picked her up off the side of the road after a night of unfortunate events. I made her a cake to celebrate finishing her first course in her adult life. Then, i helped her move a few hours away from me for school. I encouraged her, i supported her. Its her dreams and she has every reason to go after the life shd wants. 

Today I spent all day scrubbing baseboards, walls and windows for her big move out clean. Then I took her out for nachos. She's moving across the country to further pursue her dream to be a lawyer. Her grades are emaculate, her intelligence, remarkable. She's becoming everything she's ever wanted to be and more. She's my wild thing. I can't hold her back. So today, I didn't shed a tear. Well, I'm terrible at crying anyways but I expected when we hugged that last time that I would feel something rise in my throat. But it didn't. I just hugged her while she cried, reaffirmed her, then walked off. 

She's moving across the damn country! Sure we'll talk on the phone but when will I be able to hug her again? When will I be able to make her my tea that calms her and puts her to sleep so peacefully? When will I be able to go down immediately or bring her to me just because she needs me? It's a long ass flight away and it's gotta be booked in advance. But I didn't flinch. She is petrified over her choice and she continually asks me for affirmation that she is making the right choice. Of course I'm not going to cry. 

But when will I cry? When will I grieve? Will I ever grieve? What's wrong with me? Why can't I just feel and experience emotions without overthinking the pros and cons of such expressions? Why can't I cry when my beloved best friend is moving? Why can't I cry when I'm tired or stressed or sick or scared? Why am I always so damn deadpan? Why am I such a damn fucking robot? I'm an emotional robot! My emotions are preset and represented according to my calculations. I was so sure I would feel something rise up inside of me this time... but nothing... I hate this. I hate this calculated, overly considerate, and emotionless creature. I just want to live like a human

I'm a bad person and I talk behind people's backs.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"I always thought that I was a good and loyal friend and that I will back people up and stay no matter what. But I realized I did that for my own personal gain and because I didn't want to be alone. I like the center of attention to be on me and I'm very insecure and want constant validation. 

I also talk behind people's backs to others so that I can get the validation and not have to feel like I'm in the wrong. It took me a long time to realize this and now I feel like complete shit and just shattered about who I am. I don't want to be this way and I definitely don't want to hurt others. But I'm 22 and I don't think I can change this. So it would be best for me not to form any closer relations anymore."	offmychest		
Hard to swallow pill that’s repeated in my mind	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		4	"During the peak of a suicidal depression last year my brother told me “nobody around you cares for your suffering, get a grip”. 

This replays in my mind during my lowest moments and today has been one of those days where something has been trying to pull me down. My existence feels very burdensome and useless in this world today especially with the poor performance I had at work this week due to burn out.

I’m posting this here since my identity is confidential and nobody gives a fuck in the world they know me in. 

Everyday I think there is a better life out there and I’m still trying to find out who I am but people have lately ignored me including family lately and I just went through a break up from a longterm relationship

Also I got ghosted by this really nice girl right after the break up that kinda kept me afloat. After being told I was “too nice” I rode a scooter down a hill going 40 mph hoping a car woudl hit me.

"""You're insecure"""	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"Man does this bother me a lot. A few times people I know have said this to me in either a joking or callous way, people I would consider friends, and it really hurt. It was enough of a reoccuring insult for me to notice that this is something they really do think about me.

If they mentioned this in a compassionate, sympathetic way, it wouldn't irritate me so much, but it's always been worded in this derisive or mocking way. Like this is something to be ashamed of, some for which I should be criticized.

I haven't hurt anyone. I don't try to overcompensate for anything. I've always tried to be friendly. I don't engage in putting others down to make myself feel better, like some of them have. I just have really low self-esteem and have struggled with major depression for, at this point, years.

You're essentially saying to me, ""You should dislike yourself for disliking yourself!"", and that's NOT helping. I definitely do hold myself back, but it's just so hard when all those little insults accumulate and ring in my mind. Am I childish for this? Am I immature? I don't know, maybe, probably, but I try to be a good person. I'm not callous. I'm suffering from horrible depression. Saying I'm ""insecure"" is such a derisive insult, like this is a failing on my part. You're just hurting me.

I don't know. I try not to be a resentful person. But often, I'm resentful of either others or myself. Resentful out of perceived mistreatment, but I may just be extremely sensitive too and overblowing insignificant memories. But those small memories accumulate and become a weight on my mind. I want to be a good person. I don't know if I am. I just don't want to be this way. It's so hard to admit to myself that I may actually be ""insecure"" because of that derisive connotation. Maybe I am. Am I?

I don't want to victimize myself, but I'd also like for this pain to be acknowledged by people I actually know. I think I do want sympathy, I want it a lot, because it's just so rare for me to receive it. But at the same time, I don't acknowledge my depression frequently, so why should I expect this sympathy from others? I'm secretive about it.

Maybe I am a bad person. But that just continues this cycle of self-hatred. I don't hurt people, is that enough for me to be good? I'm tired of feeling like a bad person, of telling myself to commit suicide. I'm tired of feeling ashamed OF feeling ashamed of myself. It's a neverending cycle of misery that's hard to escape. It's suffocating.

Maybe I am a bad person, or maybe I'm just looking for sympathy. At least the latter is true. It's just so hard. I'm tired of feeling this way."	depression	2022-07-01T07:13:04.000Z	Complete-Lion862

I had friends in town so I'd been having a couple of later nights and my sleep suffered for it. I'm teetering on the brink of complete misery again. Don't get me wrong I'm grateful that I know things that help me manage my depression but it's so frustrating how even just a few days of not taking care of myself can break me. I'm just tired of how fragile I am.	depression		
Tried FAQ and Troubleshooting, no results	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	I recently updated spotify and as soon as I did I lost all access to my playlists, podcasts, etc. I am getting an error message saying I have no internet access but I run an unlimited data plan so that's not an issue. I am a premium subscriber, I'm not sure if it makes a difference but I figured any extra information would help. Thanks in advance for any advice.	spotify

So I have to ask, are umpires and lines-people this bad?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	13	0	"I have gotten into watching Tennis Advocate court drama videos on YouTube and, while I know these videos are cherry-picked, there are a LOT of terrible calls that I just don’t understand as a casual fan. I have seen multiple times when the lines-people call the ball ‘out’ when it hasn’t landed. How is that possible? You haven’t seen the ball land… I saw a video where the ball hit the cord on a serve and then went so clearly out and was called a ‘let’ for first service. 

Again I don’t watch a ton of tennis but even in the small amount I do watch I see just terrible decisions over and over as well. It really doesn’t surprise me that players get so frustrated sometimes. I get that we have the benefit of going back and watching things again, but quite a lot it is as clear as day from the first viewing what happened. And we have a worse angle. 

Has it always been this bad?"	tennis	2022-07-01T13:52:00.000Z	MyLeftKneeHurts-

My Brother-in-law (34) raped my Wife (27) several times when she was 12/13 and he has never seen justice for it.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	20	153	I really don’t know what to say. I feel so fucking furious, angry, and helpless. My wife comes from a religious family and they didn’t find out until I urged her to tell them when we started dating nearly 7 years ago that this happened. She was scared that no one would believe her or that it would destroy her families reputation (which is so fucked that ANYONE who was raped has to carry that and feel like they have to suppress for other peoples sake). I finally convinced her to tell her parents. I believe she told her mom first who’s first response was literally, “You must be mistaken. Your brother wouldn’t do that.” Un-fucking-believable. It wasn’t until she told outside people that pressure was put on her family to address it. They had ONE single “family meeting” and it was agreed my wife’s brother would go to therapy. He went once. Now it’s treated as something my wife just has to learn to deal with and “work out” with him. Even her other family members like her sister have told her to try and forgive him and move on. Like what the fuck?! Am I crazy for thinking everyone here is basically gaslighting my wife into believing literally being raped multiple times as minor by her fucking brother isn’t something you just work out!? I can’t talk to anyone about this. I hate this man. I want him to die. I have no idea what to do. I just needed to vent.	offmychest	2022-07-01T14:13:20.000Z	AuspiciousAce
I’m sick of conventionally advantaged people acting like victims online	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	7	I’ve noticed this pattern so much and it bothers me. Today I saw a post along the lines of “men want thick girls but no stomach, be realistic” and 90% of the comments were girls who claimed to be thick with flat stomachs getting offended by the post and men defending them. This isn’t about body types I’ve seen this on so many different posts. Like someone makes a post to hype themself up and people who have whatever desired trait act all offended in the comments and everyone defends them. I’m not overweight or insecure with my body but it just feels like they came to brag and rub it in peoples face.	offmychest	2022-07-01T14:19:44.000Z	_queen_bee01_
My family tells me im too old to be obsessed about my appearance like this, and i know they're right.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	3	"
tw: eating disorder/body dysmorphia

im growing out of teenagehood, and i am still obsessive over my appearance like a mentally ill, insecure 14 year old. i have very severe body dysmorphia and have had it since i was 13, social anxiety since i was 10, ive also developed an eating disorder in the past trying to salvage my ugly face with a nicer/thin body. i became underweight and became insecure about that too. i feel like i have no strengths, and need to compensate with beauty/looking like i have myself together. i had to take a break from school due to extremely bad mental health, so i dont have academic success i can take pride in, and am a couple years behind other people my age. i barely have any friends due to moving multiple times and introversion. i lost interest in most of my hobbies or cant get myself to start them. 

i buy a lot of pretty clothes/dress up hyper femininely, do my makeup strategically, and go to the gym originally just for looks, because being skinny from eating too little took all curves, even though it has other health benefits. i cant even keep my standards up myself, i dont allow myself to shower or wash myself if i dont go to the gym that day... which i know is super gross. i also dont allow myself to dress up pretty if im breaking out or bloated... i know no one else cares about their looks anymore like i do, but i feel like im not allowed to stop due to my lack of other strengths, others have other qualities but i dont. 
im currently somewhat trying to build other qualities by learning a foreign language, baking and gardening, but adhd makes it hard to keep things up in a way that isnt 10000% at once, then be burnt out, so unfortunately its not going as well as i hoped. i notice every imperfection on other peoples bodies and faces too due to me being so focused on my own, and i feel really bad about it. there is no trait i am confident in, and when i imagine myself having another persons body i can immediately imagine things id be insecure about then as well.

my family particularly my grandmother and sister make fun of me for it, calling me shallow, uneducated, immature or a barbie (my sister explained barbie as in, looking dolled up and selfcentered, ""no one will want to be around you""), and it really hurts. im so ashamed of myself for it, it's like im behind everyone else and completely alone in it. i have other interests such as medicine and psychology, but i wouldn't call interests a quality."	offmychest	2022-07-01T14:17:36.000Z	jenneeeyuyu
I think I'd rather have an eating disorder than get fat	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		3	"Now I (f19) know how terrible this sounds but listen. (Btw this has nothing to do with other fat people this just me being uncomfortable in my body) 

I've never been skinny in my life but I don't think I'd be considered fat, always had thick thighs n such. Anyway my eating habits have gone from eating everything to nothing over the past 2 years and currently I'm eating literally everything in my path. At first it felt good to eat so much cuz I didn't have much of an appetite for a while before but it's been a month or two now and I have a belly. I can't suck it in or do anything to make it look better n I can't live like this. I went on a trip recently n I wore a bikini but I can't post any of the photos bcuz all u can see is my belly. Mind you, I'm 5'3, have small boobs n barely any ass so there's absolutely nothing going for me. I've tried eating less and skipping lunch or dinner but I always end up eating everything in my house n I hate myself for it. I'm making myself into a monster I can't stand to look at. Which brings me to the title, as I said I've had eating issue before, all through high school as a matter of fact and at this point a desperately wish I could stop myself from eating before it goes too far because I'd rather have eating problems than gain too much weight.

TLDR: I've gained alot of weight over the past 2 months or so and I wish I could stop myself from eating so I don't get so over weight that it's too late to do anything about it, even if that means I'd be giving myself an ED in the process."	offmychest		
I think I might be asexual	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	3	I’ve never really enjoyed the thoughts of sex. I’ve never really been turned on. So I might be asexual. However, I’ve been on anti depressants since I was 12 (I turn 19 in November) so it might be that. I don’t know. And I’m completely fine with both. I accept myself for who I am, no matter what.

My friend is amazing but I want to ghost them	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	2	I’m 18, they’re 25. We’ve been friends for 3 years, I was 15/16 and they were 22/23. To make a long story short, I had a crush on a different person and that made them deeply insecure. Admittedly, I would say no to hanging out with my friend to hang out with my crush. I know that that’s hurtful but I never did it on purpose, I only noticed when they pointed it out and I offered to hang out with them more but it was already too late. They left the friend group. Later they admitted that when they left they expected me to cut off my crush to make them feel comfortable because they would’ve done that for me. We went back and forth, them constantly threatening to leave me and then them getting angry that I didn’t beg them to stay. (Side Note, i Never fought them to stay because I just feel like that’s selfish? You need a break? Okay I’m sad but I understand) anyways after a month of constant fighting, I leave our private message and tell them I can’t keep doing this, they join back the friend group and tell me “they just want everything to go back to the way they were.” Things didn’t work out between me and my crush either, wrong person right time. I was super weak and in a dark place because of my friend and they had a shoulder I could cry on and I didn’t see all the red flags. (They’re 25 as well) Regardless, I try making nice with my friend and try forgiving them for everything but another incident occurred and my friend and my old crush argued about something stupid. My friend called the way I handled it “extremely annoying” and my old crush was acting very overwhelming with me. I just couldn’t do it anymore. I left the group, it’s been like 3 weeks since I left. Everyday I feel so selfish for leaving. I had a lot of people there that I liked talking to and I’ll miss them but I just can’t be there anymore. I can’t deal with it. Meanwhile, I just want time and space to heal but my friend keeps messaging me every single day to check up on me and see how I’m doing. They’ve sent me a care package and gave me 80 dollars for my test. They’ve offered to pay for my therapy so I can feel better. They’re great and they’re trying really hard to make me feel better but I just can’t. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I should be able to just forgive them. But I know that we both have a lot of issues that we need to work through that interfere directly with our friendship. I feel so selfish. I just want to get really sick and have a valid excuse for not wanting to talk to anyone. I don’t know.	offmychest	2022-07-01T14:28:16.000Z	weakjunior
i feel immature compared to other people but idk what i can do	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"(14f)i get nervous very easily and tend to ramble, unintentionally saying shit that doesnt make sense and might be offensive(?)

im growing out of this habit but i deny what someones saying if i feel intimidated by them, then realise that what they said makes sense and that i was just being annoying and indignant

i speak soft and monotonely but when i get fired up i talk too loud? when im sarcastic people think that im being serious because my eyes are always blank, even when im smiling a bit

i cant control my own behaviour. my hands and lips constantly shake uncontrollably and i feel like my mind is somewhere else when im talking

when someone insults me and i get offended i say something twice as bad to them

i feel like i cant pick up on small details and im not that aware of my surroundings. i zone out too much instead of putting my brain to work

i have a weird social battery. i get energectic(?) talking to my classmates or friends but after a few hours i just cant function anymore and cant give back good responses

i feel like i cant vent or tell my real strugglesto most of my friends and adults iknow because theyre probably going to tell someone else, get tired of me or invalidate me again. 

sometimes when people are serious and say the wrong thing i dont correct them if they tend to lash out against me(when my ex best friend told me that i had too much confidence to not be insecure about my physical appearance, i stayed silent probably because the last time i stood up for myself she told me to calm down, glared at me and tried to make me jealous of another girl by ignoring me and laughing obnoxiously for the next week)

im prob missing some stuff but idk myself and idk if i can break out of some of them :/

ive been avoiding trying to figure out the problems with myself until today when i talked to my crush for the first time and she put me in my spot? we were at a mall with our other classmates and seperated from the others because they didnt want to go to the library. we talked for a while and it went to the subject of our chemistry class. basically, i got on a nervous ramble and said that that ‘he always stares at me while he scolds the boys for being loud’ and ‘idk if he doesnt like me or something’ im usually quiet in class and score well for chem) she said that ‘he doesnt hate you, dont say that, people might not have reasons for eye contact’ and a bit more. this broke me out of my subconscious rambling and quickly said ‘yeah that makes sense’ i think i respect her a bit more now?? i think she might find me annoying now that i said that, even though we had a lot of fun. she kinda seems like the person to not say anything if they dont like someone and just avoid them instead but i could be overthinking it. come to think of it, i shouldnt have felt so bad for that comment although it was a bit insensitive??

ive carelessly gaslighted people twice. it was harmless, but i regret it because it ruined someones impression of me and i feel like im creating a bad image for myself

i dont know when to start talking shit about others because i try to avoid drama, but when i eventually tell someone something they need to hear its at the wrong time. for example my ex best friend was acting super nice to my friend but making fun of her and being too mean behind her back and telling me to stop being a goody two shoes when i disapproved of it, but i ‘didnt want to ruin our friendship’ (even though it was already toxic im stupid) when she finally crossed the line i told my friend about it and my ex friend was directly below our flight of stairs💀💀

ive probably gotten half of these from my parents because they were abusive mostly emotionally(is mentally the same meaning lol)

alt i dont have these problems most of the time it still bothers me and idk how to even stop and i feel so fucking helpless and the bad guy. im really grateful for 2 of my classmates for checking up on me when i look like im about to have a breakdown and my friends but i hate my class and they hate each other too but we have to see each other for another 2 years so i at least have to do something about myself 

uhh anyway thanks for reading my essay have a good night !"	offmychest		
stuck in uni feel like my life is on hold	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"Hey, im feeling a bit depressed because it feels like im just passing the time with my whole life on hold. I'm in medical school, which is 5 years in my country, so a long one. Due to relationship issues and a near miss with brain cancer, I had a lot going on and failed a placement and am now having to resit my 3rd year of uni, taking my total course length to 6 years. I feel like my life is stuck and going nowhere. I'm sick of university and being a poor student. My family are from the extreme low end of earners in the uk and always have been. I grew up missing out on all the things my peers got to do and even now still do. I'm sick of it. I am desperately wanting out of being in school studying with no money, no time and no life. Theres literally nothing significant going on for the next 3 years, and I've got to  just sit and bide my time while I hate my miserable life. My student loan is barely half of a minimum wage salary and because of placements (40-50hr a week), plus travel (10-25 hours a week depending on where I'm placed), plus academic work (20hr per week) I cant get a part time job. I put on 80lbs in just over a year thanks to health issues out of my control and went from a hot, muscular body to a horrible fat mess I hate to have to see in the mirror every day, and all my clothes are ill fitting as I cant afford to buy nice new ones. At least if I could afford some nice, fashionable clothes I could dress well to feel a little bit better about how I look but nah. And while I'd appreciate the support it makes me angry when people say learn to love your body, like just no, why should i learn to love an awful piece of shit that no one else does. I do not want to learn to love myself as an objective gross mess, I want to not have my brain fuck up 18 months ago and ruin what i worked hard for. All I can afford to do after the expenses of a placement and travel is pay rent on a shitty little studio flat, eat 1 or 2 cheap  meals most days, and thats about all my money spent, if I'm lucky a bottle to drown my sorrows one night as well. I never have money to do anything more fun than sitting around my shitty little flat watching YouTube. I'm not suicidal but I really wish there was a way to not to have to live the next 3 years of this hell, like blacking out for 3 years while shit ran on autopilot or something. I was already fed up of uni and wishing it was over sooner. I am so sick and tired and fed up of being broke as fuck while so many people are out living lavish lives, I want to earn for the work I do as even just doing my university hours for minimum wage id earn  so much more than I do now. I'm sick of my life going nowhere. For the last and the next 3 years I just get to slave away unpaid and then sit around depressed in a shitty little hovel. I resent the fact I cant afford even the small nice things and will be stuck in this boat for 3 years with no hope of escape. I'm also sick of hearing 'oh but when your done your life will be great' like no shit why do you think I haven't dropped out yet, but a bright future does exactly fuck all to make the next 3 years of my life anything more than a miserable slog through hell in work and then the same boring, pointless waste of my best years that occupies my free time because I have no money to do anything to enjoy it, no ability to travel so even free things are mostly off the table as most free things need travel. I've been dropped back a year and my escape has been delayed, and I'm sick of that too. All my friends are graduating and getting to earn and live real lives, ive still got the same amount of time as a normal degree left. I'm falling out of touch with these friends as now they are earning they are doing expensive stuff with their money I can never afford to join in with, and as a result they are drifting away and leaving me lonely and depressed. What am I meant to do to actually be able to live and not just exist through the rest of my degree. I am not suicidal yet as I said but at the same time I cant see myself staying that way for 3 whole years of this shit. Id be more fine with my position if i was a layabout doing nothing with my life but I'm working twice the hours of a full time job and getting half of a minimum wage to live on, when minimum wage in full isn't even enough to live on.I'm getting a bit rambly so I'll leave my rant there

My life is a horrible scary cycle	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost		1	"I'm sad and terrified all the time.

I grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother who would routinely beat me. My Dad would sometimes step in but would just receive her verbal or physically abuse. She neve once touched my brother, he was her golden child.

I was bullied in school too - all through it - for being smaller than everyone else. I was born 9 weeks premature, due to my ""not knowing she was pregnant"" and drinking every night. So my body was always messed up with illnesses.

I would wet the bed every night until I was 10 and had to get emergency hernia surgery. I had a hernia (presumably due to the stress of abuse every day) at 10 years old and no one questioned it. Whenever a doctor or teacher would ask about my home life and school life I'd tell them how I'd beaten and abused, but it was just ""tough love"" and ""kids being kids"". 

This continued through high school until my Dad enough and left, I went with him. I had a few friends and just wanted to have fun for a change and it was good. Had some relationships and experiences and my brother left and went to college.

I'm not smart or competent and can barely keep a job. I'm a hoarder with chronic depression and OCD. 

My Mum came back into my life saying she was sick and I went and helped her. She turned out not to be sick at all. But I now stayed seeing her often because she had lied too and abused everyone in her life and is completely alone, majorly depressed. She'd nonstop whine at me like i was a child but never touch me, she can't now.

My brother then got divorced from his wife and was forced to move back to her house, after having no contact and not letting her see her grandkids for 10 years. He stayed for 3 years before escaping and moving in with someone he now deeply loves. She made his life hell while staying there.

She's now sick. Actually sick though. A mass on her Pancras and the very early stages of alzhimers or dementia. 

I'm completely alone except seeing my Dad and brother every so often. I can't maintain relationships and I'm sad and terrified and angry and bitter and lonely all the time. And she's the person who talks to me the most.

I hate this horrible cycle I'm in of being sad and lonely. I have horrible hygiene and ugly rotten teeth. I was beaten and sent to bed early everynight so I never developed the habits and now I'm horrible.

I have no skills or relationships and I can't do anything with life.

I don't know what to do."	depression

Finally seeing a therapist tomorrow!	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	In the past 2 years I’ve faced mental health issues that I’d never imagined in my life. I’ve had countless instances where I’ve considered ending my life. It’s the thought of my family that keeps me from taking any steps. Being an introvert, I’ve AWLAYS found it difficult to talk about how I feel. I’ve lived in denial for a long long time now and I’ve finally built the courage to seek professional help.

ive been avoiding trying to figure out the problems with myself until today when i talked to my crush for the first time and she put me in my spot? we were at a mall with our other classmates and seperated from the others because they didnt want to go to the library. we talked for a while and it went to the subject of our chemistry class. basically, i got on a nervous ramble and said that that ‘he always stares at me while he scolds the boys for being loud’ and ‘idk if he doesnt like me or something’ im usually quiet in class and score well for chem) she said that ‘he doesnt hate you, dont say that, people might not have reasons for eye contact’ and a bit more. this broke me out of my subconscious rambling and quickly said ‘yeah that makes sense’ i think i respect her a bit more now?? i think she might find me annoying now that i said that, even though we had a lot of fun. she kinda seems like the person to not say anything if they dont like someone and just avoid them instead but i could be overthinking it. come to think of it, i shouldnt have felt so bad for that comment although it was a bit insensitive??

ive carelessly gaslighted people twice. it was harmless, but i regret it because it ruined someones impression of me and i feel like im creating a bad image for myself

i dont know when to start talking shit about others because i try to avoid drama, but when i eventually tell someone something they need to hear its at the wrong time. for example my ex best friend was acting super nice to my friend but making fun of her and being too mean behind her back and telling me to stop being a goody two shoes when i disapproved of it, but i ‘didnt want to ruin our friendship’ (even though it was already toxic im stupid) when she finally crossed the line i told my friend about it and my ex friend was directly below our flight of stairs💀💀

ive probably gotten half of these from my parents because they were abusive mostly emotionally(is mentally the same meaning lol)

alt i dont have these problems most of the time it still bothers me and idk how to even stop and i feel so fucking helpless and the bad guy. im really grateful for 2 of my classmates for checking up on me when i look like im about to have a breakdown and my friends but i hate my class and they hate each other too but we have to see each other for another 2 years so i at least have to do something about myself

Portland getting defensive with Utah’s help	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	73	0	"While highly unlikely, an idea I’ve had (therefore a terrible idea) is Portland trading for Gobert, helping to truly transform the Blazers into a defense first team.

Utah is looking to move on from Gobert and Mitchell’s pairing and realign to a different timeline. In this case realign to Mitchell and trade out Gobert.

Just to give a possible starting point. I think a package of Nurkic, Bledsoe, a couple players plus picks/swaps does the trick for Gobert.

This gives the Blazers a center who isn’t needed to score and focus on defending. Massively improving the lack of defense they’ve had at center over the years.

Utah gains more financial flexibility as a way out of Rudy’s contract allowing for an easier pivot by the trade deadline if they wish to move Nurkic. Getting Bledsoe sucks from on offensive perspective but helps with defense and the various players/picks will help find new deals as well.

This trade really hinges on who those extra players included in deal are/the quality of picks but seems at least seems not terrible for Utah.

There is also the possibility of a 3-team trade as well to sweeten the pot for Utah."	nba	2022-07-01T14:19:44.000Z	DJ_Drayen

Superhero labyrinth	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	20	0	"I know this is going to be extremely demanding, so sorry and thanks in advance. It is a serious post and I hope no one gets offended by it.

I have neglected my superhero movies-watching. Let's say the last superheroes (SH) film I've seen is Unbreakable, and I don't have a clear idea of whose SH belong to Marvel or DC or whomever. Also I'm not a fan of... let's call them Michael Bay films (just bangs and crushes and stuff). I have 3 questions.

1. Why should I watch the recent (I'm talking 20 years back or so) SH movies? I mean, do they tackle moral, intellectual or social problems? I mean are they interesting?
2. Can you list the movies that belong to Marvel Universe and the ones that belong to DC (and if there's some other Universe, list them too? Or partially, at least.
3. In what order should I see them (year of release, or this before that for X reasons...)? Also, I know some movies have a director's cut that is really different or improves on the studio cut. In order not to have to watch them twice, which ones are them?

If there's an easier way to learn this (maybe a web or something) please let me know.

Thank you!"	movies	2022-06-30T19:46:08.000Z	theguywhocantdance
I saw the movie Marry Me, and one of the worst things about it was the abominable wig that they had on Owen Wilson.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	8	0	"This was so aggravating to me, that I just needed a moment to rant about it to get it out of my system.

[Left side is his normal hair, right side is the wig.](https://imgur.com/a/KqtN6lU)

It was like an Ellen DeGeneres reject hairpiece. It was brassy, the cut was bad, the highlights were terrible. It looked so fake. Also it looks like he had a little bit of work done, botox maybe?  And they put a lot of makeup on him, so he looked like a Madame Tussauds rendition of what Owen Wilson looks like.  When I look at the pictures of him as himself, his character would have been so much better if they just let him look how he normally looks.  I want to know who designed this look, who approved it, I just feel like someone needs to answer for this lack of visual judgment!

And the plot sounded like it could have been cute, but it was not. This couple has no chemistry. Like none. Perhaps platonic friends chemistry. The only thing it worked as is a good showcase for Jennifer Lopez still having the body the face and the vocals."	movies	2022-06-30T19:03:28.000Z	jenniferandjustlyso

how do you deal with not letting your family, friends, or coworkers not see how depressed and sad you are.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	I'm at the point that I just want to build the wall up stronger. I tried to open up to people to just talk and tell them how I feel when they ask if I'm okay or that I can talk to them. I've ended up in the ER because they got scared and then the doctors sent me home since I wasn't any harm to myself and stuck with medical bills because someone sent my text message to my parents. I just wanted to talk and they told me to talk to them. A few times I got in trouble at work because I was negative after a coworker asked how I was because I looked more sad then normal. Told them why I was feeling down and what mental health issues I deal with and told them I was fine and just had a bad day and next thing I know I had and HR meeting because of my negative mood and brining the team down. Oh and then I lost friends after I opened up to then because they asked me to open up and be honest with my feeling and talk to them with how I feel. Now days I just keep everything in. I'm alway put the mask on to hide how I feel when I'm at work. But I can feel the mask cracking and I can feel the wall has leaks in it. I'm worried I'm going to let my anger out on someone at work and worried my kid will see me crying and he is the only reason I'm still walking this plane of existence. I just feel lost in this world and just feel trap sometimes. Sorry for the long rant.

Im a horrific terrible person for the things i have done and saying them here would get me banned and make you all hate me. I’ve lied and cheated and beaten and stolen im no goody two shoes. I used to not care but lately it has made me really guilty. The things i used to do and in some cases concurrently do, haunt me. The world is a senseless evil void and everyday im haunted by my loss and my trauma. Im never distracted for long and im never happy for long. I have no meaningful relationships outside my family and im very lonely. I ruined my relationships with all my good friends for various reasons. Im in so much pain for so long now. I just want it all to go away and nothing works. I (15f) dated a girl for two years only for her to overdose on illicit drugs and die. Its not known if it was a suicide or an accident but it destroyed my world. She was the only person who ever really got me. Or made me feel loved or like people mattered. Even if our relationship had its flaws we got along well. Now im a predator, sucking the essence out of everyone before i leave them to rot. I just become obsessed with someone, date them, then get everything out of them quickly and then screw up the relationship or leave them and move on to the next. Im an abusive person and i hurt people. I have violent tendencies and im afraid i might hurt myself or others again if i get emotional because i cant control myself.

Im constantly losing interest in things I used to love so much, hurting people i care abt the most, pushing away any kind of help, and trying to handle everything alone. Ive never been diagonsed for my mental health but my mom has really bad anxiety,depression,bipolar. I have very clear symptoms of all three which is great. I dont know why I have to do so much just to keep up with my mental health. It makes me feel so crazy and not normal and im constantly comparing how i see things to other people. Ï have to convince myself to be happy and my only escape are drugs. I have such a bad addiction to any type of drug I get my hands on and it scares me so bad. Ive tried so hard to stay away from tobacco and alcohol and everything else because I know if i even try it, i will get addicted. Ive been smoking weed for months and have tried to stop but its just gotten worse. I fucking tried dxm because i was out of weed 2 days ago and it was terrible and all it did was make me feel fucking worse about myself. I was doing so good. I have been going to the gym and got a job since summer started but this week alone Ive done nothing because of the breakdown I had. Ive never had a therapist and my mom says she will get me one but never does. My dad is constantly disappointed in me and its so obvious. Im such a let down to everyone I know; i lost my best friend last year which has since made me feel so lonely. I have barely any friends. I dont even think therapy would help, in fact I dont think anything can fix what is wrong with me. Im too scared to kill myself, and I dont wanna leave my sister either. I am only writing this because I cannot stop crying and I have no one else to talk to, i rarely open up to anyone and when i do nothing fucking happens.

My anger is out of control	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	14	11	"I am 15.

It started as simple 'getting angry', and it has now progressed into breaking things, hurting myself, and lashing out at others.

It happens out of nowhere– someone might make a joke and carry on for too long, or I might get frustrated at not being able to do something, simple things like that. Minor inconveniences. Today someone shouted at me and it sent me into a fit of rage and sobbing.

I still feel nauseous now. It lasted about an hour. I know that what happened was my fault, and that how I reacted was way out of proportion. But it's so uncontrollable, and it comes on so suddenly, that I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to hurt people.

I was lifting weight on the bench and was irritated at her bringing her friends over because I just wanted to have a peaceful night. 

Words were exchanged and I called her a C*nt. She then proceeded to push the weights out of my arms (it was two 35lb dumbells) while I was lifting which could’ve injured me at which point I dropped them on the floor and got really mad. 

I got up from the bench and pushed her yelling at her saying I could’ve hurt myself and she proceed to try to hit me with her hydro flask which she actually did once leaving swelling on my arm. This just got me even more mad. I said I was going to “bash her head in.” I know that’s terrible but what’s even worse is that I really was going to go do it. I could see myself doing it. I was beginning to walk towards her and I only stopped when my aunt yelled at me to just go back to my room.

Ugh I was an asshole today	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	7	15	So I’m currently in the process of a break up with someone who has very bad anger issues and often says incredibly mean and abusive things when angry. Like truly shocking things.  Been 6 months of our relationship being truly mentally abusive. It’s been a lot to go through. I’ve been very sad and in another world. Today on the train the inspector wouldn’t accept my ticket and I flipped at him like crazy calling him all sorts. He was in the right technically but I was thinking come on man it’s like a very small amount in price difference -do me a solid and let me go. But I didn’t say that I flipped. And I was MEAN too which is not like me. After I  just stood there on the platform after the train pulled away. Then it dawned on me how crazy that was. Like 0-100 black out anger. I’m burning with shame at behaving like this publicly in my mid 30s like some petulant teenager lol. And on top of that I’m paranoid someone filmed me being an asshole haha. Don’t get me wrong - even if there was no one around, I’d feel bad, I never behave like this. It’s the first time in my life I’ve ever said exactly everything  I wanted to (remember Seinfeld, the comeback? I Got my jerk store moment in) and it didn’t feel good. This is a turning point for me. I looked like some crazy frothing at the mouth Karen. Ugh I’m so ashamed.

I was asking her to move out the way of the door so I could leave because the anger was too much and she kept blocking it, and I literally could not take it. I had such a strong urge to hit her. I never would and I didn’t, but I did throw my phone at the wall. I wasn’t even thinking, it just took over like an instinct reaction.

My girlfriend is shook up because she’s never seen me do anything like that, and I’m not gonna lie I’m getting intrusive thoughts that I’m abusive because of it. I feel like such an asshole for scaring her so much. I love her and the fight was nothing compared to others - i think it was just everything else on top.

Work Drama	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	I work at a dance club where I dance.  There is a bartender there that consistently has a bad attitude. I know it’s not personal but she just always acts very rude. A customer came in before I’d arrived to work and asked her if I was coming in. She acted as if she didn’t know who I am. I’ve been working at this club for 6 months and we’ve spoken on multiple occasions. Later that same night I was going to the bathroom and talking to another dancer and mentioned the a bartender was making me feel angry.  The bartender over heard and popped out the bathroom and aggressively said, “do you have a problem” I said “what?” And then I asked her if she knew my name because I wanted to see if she was genuinely being funny earlier or if she didn’t know my name and she was like why does it matter and we argued and I walked away and peed. And when I came out the bathroom the bartender along with another bartender was waiting for me outside the bathroom.  She told me to watch my mouth then I told her I’m going to say what I want and that she should make me. The manager broke up the argument it didn’t get physical but then 3 days later the manager had us go to the office and attempt to talk it out where she accused me of saying I was gonna fight the bartenders and I refused to admit to saying that cause I didn’t. Then she told him it was either her or me and he made me leave.   I feel so angry because often times I vent or talk about situations where I have problems to get another opinion. I want to resolve this problem but she’s refusing to talk further and I refuse to admit to saying something I didn’t say. What do I do?	Anger	2022-06-29T04:26:40.000Z	Peachycaet
Reddit is no better than Facebook	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	30	5	First I get treated like the bad guy for trying to share some positivity in a beard group. Then  again when I posted something else in another group and put on a 3 day post ban for hate speech when I said nothing hateful.  Then banned from an autistic group and immediately put on a 7 day post ban for harassment when i tried to message the mod for the autistic group to figure out why. And now banned for 7 days from the Am I The Asshole group for simply agreeing with everyone about OP’s brother being a piece of shit. Reddit clearly doesn’t want me here and I’m tempted to deactivate my account. I really didn’t even wanna be here anyways but my controlling manipulative ex wife forced me to.

I’m angry because I hate my life.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	5	I’m honestly so angry that my face is in a constant state of frowning. Half a year ago I was so happy and things were going so well. It was until I got led on by a girl when I started loosing sleep because of my anxiety disorder and ended up getting injured. Training means the world to me and now I can’t train like I used to and I’m a shell of the person I was. I’m angry that I got led on by a coward who couldn’t just be upfront when I directly asked and I’m angry that I’ve been injured for over half a year and feel horrible physically. I think I might eventually heal up from the injury and am trying to rehab it but I hate my life so much right now and I hate that it was caused from my anxiety.

dealing with anger issues since my brother's suicide	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	7	15	My brother shot himself in 2017 a few days before Christmas and we found him on Christmas.

Advice for Control	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"Let me preface this with I need advice for my significant other. He has anger issues. He is not abusive, manipulative with his words, has never been violent, and his anger is usually stemmed out of inanimate objects or protecting me. I am NOT concerned about him hurting me, that is not the issue. I would like some advice to help him get control of himself a bit more in those intense moments. I am perfectly safe and I’ve never felt unsafe.

My significant other has always struggled with his temper growing up. As an adult, it’s barely noticeable. We have been dating for two+ years and I only notice his anger get to an uncontrollable point… two or three times a year, if not less. For the most part, when he gets to his angry point, it’s generally over inanimate things he’s frustrated with. (Computer acting up, phone acting up, etc.) he never breaks things. We have found a general good system where I leave him alone for a period of time until he’s calm and he can apologize and collect himself. He hates me being around him when he’s upset because he doesn’t want to say something to me he doesn’t mean, so distance works best.

This past weekend was different, however. He came home already a bit frustrated due to unexpected traffic to see me crying. I was upset over a company who essentially screwed me over in something that admittedly was out of the company’s control, but it put a big burden on me. The details of the company and the situation are irrelevant. However, my significant other called the company in pure rage. He demanded they fix it, he yelled at the manager, threatened to sue, etc. His hands were shaking, etc. It was the worst I’ve seen him.

I personally draw the line when it comes to being disrespectful to other people. While the situation was frustrating, and it is the company’s fault, I also recognize that the employees at the small shop for a National company can’t do much about it. So, I tried to talk to my significant other, get him to calm down or even just listen to me for a moment and he physically couldn’t. He hated seeing me cry because of something they did and in his protective nature he wanted to get it fixed. It also didn’t help he was frustrated to start with.

I talked with him about it that night gently. That I appreciate him looking out for me, but that he was to an uncontrollable point and I didn’t like seeing that. He felt awful, naturally, but it’s tough for him to manage in the heat of the moment. I compared my needing help with anxiety to his anger, that needing a bit of help isn’t bad, but I wouldn’t mind some tips for this situation. Can anyone relate or give me advice as to how should I approach supporting him? From what you can read, does professional help seem appropriate? Perhaps some self help techniques? The problem is that it doesn’t happen very often, so it’s not as though he can practice it tricks like I can with anxiety.

Thank you!"	Anger	2022-06-28T17:04:00.000Z	AllisonWonder

My anger is devolving into suicide ideation	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	30	30	"The long and short of it is: I have anger problems, and always have. My husband and I had an intense therapy session and he shared that he can’t handle it, that every day he is only wondering how to navigate from one thing to the next without making me angry, and is even desensitized to it in the sense that he doesn’t even care since everything makes me angry.

He’s right. And I’ve never heard him say it before and hearing it made me feel like the scum of the fucking earth. I’ve been on meds and in therapy my whole life. I’m in my late 30s. It’s never going to change.

I’m scared of the anger I’m feeling rn	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	4	4	I have this raging fire that’s burning the hottest of reds inside of me. I can feel the pressure and tenseness in my muscles. I can’t handle small situations without feeling like I’m going to lose my temper in a really bad way right now. My mind is so loud it’s deafening. I just want to scream, I want to hurt something without actually hurting anyone. This feeling of hatred is rippling through my soul. To think the person I considered my soulmate could hurt me like that, makes me fucking angry. I can’t even tell if I’m in pain, or shock, because all I can feel is hate right now. I’m not okay.

Why are we so angry?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	7	14	"Can someone please explain why we get so angry? By “we,” I mean people that get angry easily. I have have struggled with anger my entire life. I just found this page and am hoping it will help. Someone I don’t even know very well gave me a nickname about it. I hate this so much about myself and I feel so embarrassed whenever I reach the point of anger and I behave rudely. I hate that it feels like I don’t have control over it. 

Why is it that some people just seem to not experience this emotion, or experience it to a much lesser degree? It makes me so jealous 😭 Is it genetics? Is it just learned? It feels so unfair. Both of my parents had anger issues, so there is that. But I still don’t understand why.

I have been getting better about controlling it over time, but it’s seriously a struggle everyday. It constantly feels like people are jerks who don’t have common decency or are just plain inconsiderate or selfish, and I need to protect myself from them.

So far what I do is just remove myself from the situation (ignore or avoid it) and then come back (like in a romantic relationship). But even when I do return sometimes I still feel angry. I try to speak amicably but I just can’t without it coming across as defensive and somewhat bitchy. 

What can I do to control my anger in the moment besides removing myself from the situation? Maybe if I focus on breathing while I’m away then it’ll be better when I return. Thank you so much for any thoughts."	Anger	2022-06-27T07:47:12.000Z	Known_Studio_7373
My wife is Angry and blaming me for everything	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	10	8	"We are visiting my in-laws (her parents) in her country since past 10 days, and from the day we landed here; she has started blaming me for things which are out of my control.

We haven’t spoken properly since the day we got here. 

She doesn’t want me to get involved in any decisions or discussions. As soon as I try to say something she shows me her eye,  does hand gestures or presses my arm if she’s sitting next to me.

I spoke to her about this and she replied that my suggestions in any matter are not valid and no one wants to hear them

Whenever I talk to her she ignores me and walks away or keeps her eyes glued to her phone.

She has anger issues and everyone in her family knows about it.

I’m anger at the fact that I feel like I’m developing anger issues	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	2	"I haven’t been like this before. For most of my life I have been a normal person who only gets very angry in extreme circumstances. 

Since late April I’ve been getting angrier and more upset over things that used to not bother me as much. They would often have to do with my parents, my brother, school, and bad memories. 

I’ve become way more argumentative and unable to move on from things that made me angry. Sometimes I’ll be going about my day and randomly I’m put into a bad mood because I remember an argument or something bad that happened with someone. 

This all came a climax about 2 weeks ago when I had an incident with my brother. 

My mom sent him to call me for dinner but he knocked on the door very hard and after I opened it asking him why he did that he says “it’s time for dinner bitch!”

In less then 15 seconds I go from ok to annoyed to pissed off after hearing him insult me. I screamed FUCK YOU back at him before being called down by mom. As I’m sitting down I’m breathing heavily feeling like I have to shield the blast to my rage. My mom tells me to go to my room and I go. I slam the door shut before spending 3 minutes thrusting my fists against the walls of my room while screaming profanities and insults berating my brother and everything I hate about him. I screamed over and over as loud as I could hearing my voice echo off the walls while I insulted my brothers obesity, his interests and personality. I screamed about how much I hated him and why he couldn’t just fuck off and die already. It got so bad my mom comes up and tells me to shut up otherwise I’ll be punished. 

In that moment I had to act scared and agree to it when in reality I wanted to rip the door open and slam her skull into the walls of the hallway while berating and screaming at her for telling me to silence my rage. 

15 minutes pass and I’m calm enough to come down and eat dinner. 

This is a complete shit show and I don’t see it getting better at all right now."	Anger	2022-06-27T00:08:32.000Z	batmanfan90

I was out last night and I was already pretty drunk. As I was walking through a crowd a guy just grabbed my drink and took it. In that instant I just shrugged and moved on, not worth getting into a fight over £4 worth of alcohol. But its just kept building, and building and building. 

This fucking guy offered me a sip of my own fucking drink, which I denied. A security guard bought me a new drink and gave me a lecture on how I shouldn't let that happen, which was nice, his heart was in the right place. But its humiliating. 

When I finished my drink I was digging my fingernails into my palm to stop myself shattering the bottle over his head. I should have fucking killed him. But I kept a level head. I swallowed my pride in the name of not causing a scene.

I've spent thousands of hours working out. On the outside I'm no longer that little rake thin kid that cried when someone took his lunch. But apparently I still fucking am on the inside. It was all for FUCKING NOTHING fuck."	Anger	2022-06-26T14:19:44.000Z	Throwawaysoletsgo

I’m scared of being angry	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"I hate that my thoughts can get so mean and violent when I get angry (and the anger always comes from the most stupid situations). It’s like I become a person that I don’t want to be or that I’m living the life of two different people. I’m terrified that one day I won’t be able to control myself and I’ll turn into a person who is constantly mean and awful. 

Today my cats were trying to eat food off of my plate. I got so annoyed and wanted to just push them off the table. Of course I’m not gonna do that so I pushed them lightly and walked away and went into a room away from them. I was so scared that I was gonna shove them off the table aggressively because I was so annoyed and I could feel my body filling with rage. I hate that I got so angry about the dumbest shit. They are cats and didn’t do anything wrong. I’m scared that I shouldn’t be a pet owner because of shit like this. I love my cats to death but I’m terrified that I’m not gonna control my anger and truthfully I don’t want to keep living knowing that I can feel this level of anger at the most dumb shit.

Hi. New to this sub, and I’ve been really angry lately.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	3	"Hey everyone. I apologize if this is a bit of a useless “vent” type post but I’m not sure what to say. I’ve been really angry lately. I’m not entirely sure why. My life is much better in a lot of ways than it’s ever been, but despite that I’m angry almost all the time lately. I’m not sure when it started. Maybe I’ve always been angry inside? Lately though - maybe for the past year? Maybe more? I’ve been angry to the point where I would gladly hurt somebody in the moment. After it passes I feel stupid and embarrassed, but in the moment it feels like it would be literally orgasmic to hurt the person I’m angry at. I got out of my car a few months ago and tried to pull a guy out of his, but he locked his door and rolled the windows up. I’ve been really short with my kids lately too. I don’t tech that level with them, but I get really short and irritable and yell at them, which generally isn’t me. I’ve always been really affectionate and patient with my kids, but lately I’m so easily annoyed and angered. I got into a Facebook argument with some guy that’s friends with my aunt today and afterward I looked up his place of business and was seriously considering going there and waiting for him. Over a fight on the internet - things I’ve been laughing about since dial up. 

Again, I’m sorry this is such a rambling mess of a post, I just felt like I had to say this to somebody and it seemed like maybe this was the place. I just know this isn’t me, or at least not the best me I’m capable of being, and I don’t really know what to do about it. I just want to go back to not wanting to hurt people and being able to enjoy my family again."	Anger	2022-06-26T00:00:00.000Z	The_Secorian
How to Help an Angry Mofo?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	5	2	"My 15yo God-Daughter has had anger issues for a while and her relationship with her parents is quite turbulent. She's been sectioned for an eating disorder and is taking her stress out on the staff. The advice she's been given, to channel it into writing and art just isn't cutting it. She's got a need for control, food is just a part of that, and being sectioned, force fed, physically weak and out of control in so many ways is just making it worse.

I have basically told her anger is okay and a step up from depression bc she is saying to herself 'the way things are now is not okay, and I'm feeling strongly about changing them'. It's a fuel, a driving force in moderation.. The apathy of depression (she is/was suicidal) is burned away in the firey rage of anger. I said this as girls (and some boys) are told not to be angry and I think that's a mistake. The cortisol is still going to be there but it's compressed, internalised and turned inwards. Being angry isn't bad in itself. But maybe I'm just saying this as I haven't been on the receiving end of it. 

It feels kind of wrong to tell her that being angry is okay. While it's true that I think it is, I also don't think that taking it out on other people is alright. But I don't want to tell her to repress her rage for the reasons above. Healthy outlets might work for 40% rage but they can't touch someone who is at 90% on the pressure cooker. At the moment she hasn't got her phone to talk to her friends and I am probably the only person with whom she hasn't been all spinny-headed, growley, and prone to levitation. 

What, if anything, should I say about her taking her anger out on others?"	Anger	2022-06-25T17:48:48.000Z	OnTheTopDeck
My boyfriend has anger issues	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	31	14	I'm currently dating a man who has problems controlling his anger and stress. He used to lash out a lot but I've talked to him about it and ever since then, he doesn't lash out anymore. Instead, he would isolate himself from others so he doesn't get mad at them. He likes it if people listens to him. There are times where I didn't listen to him because I thought what he was saying was ridiculous and he would keep talking in a stressed tone and saying hurtful things until I give him space. He won't yell at me... but the way he's reacting to this is really bothering me. Whenever he's angry, I just get so much anxiety. I already suffer from anxiety and him giving me more anxiety isn't doing me any good. Often times I would just suck it in and do whatever he says so that he wont get mad. I'm a dominant person myself and I hate doing this.  I'm doing it because I love him and I hope he does change... I'm always calm whenever he's angry so that I don't become the fuel to the fire. This hurts me even more because I have to sit through the hurtful things he says to me. Hurtful words he says: leave me alone, I don't want to see your face, why do you keep doing stupid things and etc... what can I do about this? I love him a lot and I want to sit through it with hope that he can change. I'm just worried that I'll be fed up one day and leave him... and i dont want to leave him. He's a good person. He loves and cares for me a lot. The only downsides are his problems in controlling his stress and anger.	Anger	2022-06-25T12:52:16.000Z	Realistic_Addendum82
Deep deep unflinching rage — so bad it terrifies me	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	4	0	"I have rage within me. Rage like a billion angry babies wailing in unison to an orchestra of Stravinsky or Beethoven just as the music hits a crescendo. 

I am terrified of what this may mean or say about me. Am I dangerous? Could I kill a person without hesitation? 

I don’t understand why I feel this way. Today I had my first outburst in a long time. I was talking on the phone with a scammer who was claiming to be a customer service rep who would shut down my line if I don’t follow his instructions. In a few moments I found myself becoming more privy to the likelihood of the situation and eventually hung up. But during the conversation I screamed at the top of my lungs at him as he continued to disrespect me and attempt to manipulate me. It was a bit nerve wracking. I’ve managed to calm down but in the course of the conversation I realized how in spite of all the progress I thought I had made with meditation, I’m still just this crazy unstable person. It’s a bit tormenting.

The worst part about it tho is I live in a hostel for university students and I’m afraid the people in the building may have heard me which is INCREDIBLY embarrassing.

I found great relief with EMDR and a good therapist.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	5	13	I tried yoga, meditation, martial arts, analytic talk therapy, CBT, hiking, the Wim hof method. All of these helped me become a super aware person. I used my anger as fuel and put it in charity project or society projects. But they didn’t helped with the core issue, I still was deemed a “very reactive person”. After all this year, I was diagnosed with CPTSD and started EMDR therapy. The change has been night and day. I have a very angry child inside of me, trapped in my nervous system. Anger was the coping mechanism that kept me alive during my difficult childhood, and it changed my whole wiring because I was growing as it happened. I don’t need it anymore, but until I address the trauma inside, it will stay there to “protect me”. Anger is not psychological, it is a nervous system problem, a physical thing.I started resolving the trauma inside, the anger started to go away!! After 20 years. I really can’t recommend enough finding a good therapist and starting EMDR. Changed my life.	Anger	2022-06-24T08:19:12.000Z	Simple_Employee_7094

2 weeks in a new workplace, 1 explosion already baybee.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	7	"2 Weeks. A new workplace driving a forklift, a coworker whose name I do not know was being abit of passive agressive twat this week, kinda taking the role of the ""frustrated mentor"" IE if he saw me doing something inefficiently he'd come up and go ""**sigh** Don't you understand you have to do  xyz like this? Why are you xyz\`?"" and generally peppering me with inane questions. 

Today the morning went badly, lack of sleep, up at 5:30 getting ready, everything that could go wrong did go wrong, then I see him glide by saying something.

**instant angry**

I mutter swears while doing work in a frantic pace, I can feel the world tune out and my heart beat faster, he says something towards me and I snap my fingers at him frantically and ask him if its ""his stuff"" ( Some boxes and other stuff that was in the way), he answers something but i instantly shut him down with some halflucid muttering, he can tell i'm angry, I can tell he can tell, and it honestly embarasses me as much as it makes me feel release, finally a confrontation from all the passive buildup? A momentary euphoria with a high price.

 He tells me to calm down and take some breaths, I almost finish the work but then, the world shattering event happens:

&gt;!A metal guard falls off the pallet when i'm just about to close in the lane O\_O!&lt;

""Never go full r word - Kirk Lazarus""

I drag this 65 kg heap of metal with pure indignation, how could it do this to me? I say the vilest swearwords while my eyes dart around madly looking for a trigger to release my anger, I find nothing but the metal shackle in my hands.

I gave him a curtsy nood on the way home and he gave one back, so I think we're cool, but I am embarassed by this childish tantrum, and I have a feeling there will be loads more to come, this is just the second week in a 6 month contract, fucking hell, I am already tired.

i hate myself so much	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	8	everyday at work i end up so enraged i have violent and aggressive thoughts. i start giving an attitude, get visibly aggressive, all that. it feels like i can’t control myself. i try to calm myself down when im angry and my brain immediately says “shut up, that’s stupid”. i should take breaks and im supposed to but i feel too embarrassed to admit im that angry. a customer walks near me, im immediately pissed again and thinking “of course im standing here and you come over here and bother me specifically??” then they talk to me and they’re really nice and i feel bad. im trying so hard to be better, i have less arguments with my friends, with my mom it’s a different story cause she’s where j got all of this from in the first place. i try to keep a good relationship with my coworkers but i know they can feel how upset i am constantly and it makes them like me less. i don’t know what to do. sometimes i think it’s better off if i start to do drugs agajn or just kill myself because i feel like i’m a. horrible person. meds don’t work. i’m in therapy and i just started, i have one coping skill that helps delay the onset of anger but it doesn’t make it go away completely.

Extreme anger when kept awake and can't sleep... advice?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"I never considered myself an angry person. I have a lot of patience. I don't get road rage, have never been in a fight, and generally just seek harmony. But when I'm trying to sleep and am kept awake by human or animal-made sounds, I get so angry, to the point where I consider violent solutions. I'm talking about situations where I've been trying to sleep for hours, and something repeatedly wakes me *just* as I'm falling asleep, and I have to be up in one hour. It's like I become another person.

I recently did something that I will not admit here, because while it isn't really that big of a deal, I'm a sensitive person and feel so guilty. I've been crying about it for days. I realize that I can completely avoid my anger if I can just fall asleep, but I love cats and I don't want to just be single for the rest of my life because everyone seems to make some noise when they sleep. I can't fall asleep with headphones or earplugs because my ears are physically very sensitive. I play white noise, but if it's at a volume where it completely drowns out noise, it alone prevents me from sleeping. I'm really not interested in trying medications because I don't actually have insomnia or anything. I'm just bothered by noise... and my partner does have insomnia; he takes pills, so he falls asleep in like 2 seconds. But if I fall asleep before him, my sleeptalking will keep him up, and with Ambien, that's bad... Often, we sleep in separate rooms, but sometimes I can hear him from even a different floor, and even if that's not the issue, the cats just randomly meow all night. I've tried everything to address that, too. I also worry about how I will react if I ever become a mother and have babies crying in the middle of the night. So I feel like I need to figure out how to manage my anger while being kept awake.

The only thing I do that works is to stop trying to sleep. But then I don't even have a chance to get any sleep at all, and I find it hard to drive and do my job without any sleep. I don't even have anger management techniques that I use in other scenarios to apply here because I simply just don't get angry, at least not to this degree. Like, I'll yell at the TV when someone does something stupid or get frustrated when doing something difficult, but it just kind of goes away after 2 seconds. But all-encompassing, stomach-burning rage is not something I experience in other scenarios. I feel like my level of anger here is unusual and inappropriate, but I just don't know what to do."

Never Got Angry Until…	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"Until loosing my 7week old daughter in march of 2021, I was a doormat.

My daughters father didn’t meet me in my hometown to host her memorial as planned so I stayed down here and gathered my things one day I spent 7 hours north of my southern east coast town. Since being treated like trash and talked trash about and have some of the worst things possible happen to me. I can see why I’d start to become irritable.

I wanted to start playing tennis recreationally, so I bought rackets. Today my wonderful boy friend drove us to the tennis courts. After 15 minutes of hitting the ball back and forth, and me struggling with my poor hand-eye coordination, I couldn’t stop myself from becoming tearful, and I told my boy friend I didn’t want to play anymore.

I felt frustrated, angry, and embarrassed. I want to play tennis with him, but not until I am minimally decent at it. I am now trying to find ways to practice tennis alone for a few weeks.

I suck at communicating	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	5	"For context my gf is 23 and I’m 22

Since I was a kid I have always had trouble expressing my frustration, sadness, or anger. I was a pretty happy child but I struggled with expressing my feelings. 

Especially frustration and anger- fits usually began with me hitting myself my head, almost like craving to punch something and also want to feel something. I was able to have these anger fits in private since it’s much quieter then other peoples rage fits. Now as an adult, I still silently struggle with processing my feeling and am especially stumped at anger. 

 I just got into anther terrible fight with my girlfriend. No matter how hard I try I truly feel I am doomed to never b able to have a productive and peaceful relationship. 

I love my girlfriend but she can be high matience  and demanding emotionally. At times She is full of life and passionate about everything, and able to express herself clear and concisely. However at other times, she is also very sensitive and can go through long periods of depression with an expectation that I should just know when she isn’t okay and be able to be more sensitive towards her and aware during these Times. 

Often leaving me feeling emotionally overwhelmed and inadequate. 

i work hard to provide us a comfortable lifestyle and Needless to say I am often exhausted and try my hardest to be a good boyfriend in the ways I know how. 
I’m not emotionally absent but as someone who struggles with my feelings I am so exhausted at always being emotionally present and usually wrong in arguments.

I just don’t  know if my anger personality can handle her personality and needs. I’m tired of loosing my temper bc I suck att expressions my feelings with someone who is a much better communicator than me ."	Anger	2022-06-20T05:28:32.000Z	MachineOverflow
A huge mistake against my manhood	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	1	"Hey reddit, I'm struggling to get over the embarrassment I feel over a slightly abusive friendship I got out of three years ago. It took a while after I moved away from this guy to really reflect on how one sided this friendship was and what a shitty friend he had been the whole time.

This guy called me stupid and an idiot a couple of times, he ignored me pretty often when I spoke to him, refused to ever come up to my place when we hung out over the weekends so I went to pick him up, drive him to my place, then drop him back off at his place some times when we hung out. There were a few times he banged my mouse against the table when we were played League together anytime he made a bad move, almost breaking my mouse. I was 29 at the time, and up to this period I was simply lacking in assertiveness and didn't know how to stand up for myself or call him out for any of these little transgressions. To be fair to myself, I did snap at him the one time he called me an idiot after I made a bad move in League, and he made a reluctant apology after that, and I forgave him, but that was the only time I spoke against him treating me like shit. Also, I was just really stressed and depressed in that big city, working a really stressful job and being away from home, so I simply wanted a friend to hang out with over the weekends, even though clearly in retrospect he was a really shitty friend.

There was this one particular thing he did though, that really bothered me, not at the moment but after I had returned home and reflected on how he had treated me. There were two or three times throughout the friendship where he placed his hand on my shoulder, randomly or when there was a pause in whatever conversation we were having, and just held it there for a few seconds while giving me a blank look. I didn't think much about it each time he did it, I probably thought he was just expressing his friendship in some quirky way even though it was a little bit overfamiliar. I think I just smiled or gave a slight chuckle each time.

On the final day I was in that city, when I decided I had enough of working that really stressful job and just wanted to return home (I was extremely depressed and stressed and distraught at the time) I told this friend that I had enough of that city, I was going to return home that day and asked if he wanted to hang out shortly one last time before I left and he agreed. He took that opportunity to basically shit on me the entire time and rub in my face that I couldn't survive in that city. He kind of gave me some light, playful punches like a fighting game character as soon as I walked into the room, called me stupid when I asked this one question while we played one last round of League, and he made that shoulder gesture one last time before I left. At this point it was pretty obvious to me he was just trying to get under my skin, so I felt like not showing any reaction to get under his skin in return. Also, I was just feeling too exhausted and defeated from the stress of that big city and job to get angry about him putting his hand on my shoulder.

So this is what is eating me up inside, what is absolutely haunting me everyday since a few months after I had come back home from that city. Looking back on those 3 or 4 times total, when he placed his hand on my shoulder like that, I can't believe that I didn't react with more anger or agitation. The first 2 to 3 times he did it, I just saw them as an expression of friendship, and the last time he did it on that last day before I drove away, I just saw it as him being a dick and trying to annoy me since I had outlived my usefulness to him (giving him rides from work, paying for some meals for him before he found a job of his own, letting him play League on my PC etc.) and felt it was just best to ignore him.

Well now, looking back at that hand on my shoulder gesture, it actually seemed extremely insulting, demeaning, even emasculating. I feel like I can't carry any dignity as a man now, having reacted with that little anger towards a gesture like that. It was basically a nonverbal way of him asserting dominance over me or calling me his bi†ch. I'm constantly ruminating over that and wondering how the hell I reached the age of 29 and not even realizing how insulting that gesture can be between two men. I feel deeply ashamed over it.

Normally, all my life, I didn't really grow up in a masculine household or have really masculine friends, it's never something I paid much thought to. The thing is, I had been reading a bunch of blogs and 'manosphere' stuff online around the same time I had moved to that city, and a common theme in all that online content was that every man has an obligation to be a real man, there is only one way to be a real man, that you have to assert dominance over as many men as many times as you can get away with, and failure to do so will make you a bi†ch or a pussy or less of a man. You have to be a real man in the traditional sense to earn respect from other men or to be attractive to women.

So this is why, after reflecting on all of that friend's behavior after I had returned home, I'm just so fvcking ashamed of myself. Like I have no reason to call myself a man or to hold any sense of dignity. I was lacking assertiveness sure, and all of the insulting shi† he pulled with me was humiliating enough, but that hand on my shoulder gesture was by far the worse. I'm literally kicking myself all day, everyday for not understanding out insulting that gesture can be between two men. It's just so fvcking embarrassing and I don't know how to roll it into my identity or self concept. What do I do here?"	Anger	2022-06-20T03:12:00.000Z	thr0waway3028
I get filled with anger and resentment over the slightest transgression	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	8	20	"This has been something that has haunted me since I was a child.

If anyone does anything against me, even in the slightest way, I get filled with anger and resentment. I have vivid, violent thoughts. It can last for days or even years.

The other day, some lady was walking towards me and the stupid bitch expected me to make way for her and when we got close, she yelled at me very briefly. I didn't process it at first but then it ruined my entire day. I had very violent thoughts and came up with many ideas on how to have handled this lady who would not be able to defend her against me. Eventually, the anger subsided but whenever I recall the incident, the anger comes back.

This is just one example over many decades of my inability to handle anyone doing anything to me, no matter how small. I can recall situations from decades prior where people have said or done things to offend me and I still feel a bit of anger over it. I don't even know how much time I've lost to my mind being consumed by these incidents...and I don't know how to change myself to not get so resentful over these things...or if it is even possible.

I Need Help Understanding My Anger	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	7	"So alittle backstory. I have dealt with anger issues my entire life. As a 31 year old man I can sit here and tell you I still have no idea how to control it. When I get in those states, it literally is impossible. I can sit there and recognize that I’m in the wrong, I’m being stupid and need to calm down. Still, no amount of time or common sense gets me out of it. 

I’ve learned for some reason my thing is, my anger feeds off someone else’s anger. An example of this, I can come from work with absolutely no legit reason to be anger it just kinda came randomly midday and never left. I then go out of way for whatever reason to act stupid to my fiancé. She notices and even tries to comfort me, doesn’t work tho. I keep pushing on every stupid immature thing I can say. Eventually, she then gets mad. Cusses at me, tells me not to speak to her the rest of day. Now, once that happens…it’s like my anger just vanished on the spot. The child is gone, and normal me comes back. At this point, trying to calm her down and failing. Sitting there upset and sad, ass kissing the rest of the day. 

Like what???? How does that make sense. 


Anyways, lately I’ve been having another issue that I just can’t understand. So my fiancé likes to go out a lot with friends. She’s very extroverted while I’m introverted as it gets. We are not the jealous type at all, honestly outside my anger our relationship is perfect.  However, when she goes out…the following morning when I wake up, like clockwork and I’m SUPER PISSED. In the anger state that I explained above. All I do then is go off about how late she was out, or if anyone was trying to grab on her, just saying dumb shit whatever I can think of. Always ends up in her not talking to me the rest of the weekend and me promising to change, but don’t. MIND YOU, before I go to sleep at no point do I pay any mind to what she’s doing. I know exactly what she’s doing and where’s she is going and doesn’t faze me as long as she having fun. Then I go to sleep and the anger comes spreeing out. 

Please help me in trying to figure out the root cause of this, or the direction to look. Why do I have this sick ritual?"	Anger	2022-06-18T19:46:08.000Z	Wonderful_Stuff2595

Helpless feelings = Anger	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	6	13	"I realize that a lot of negative emotions lead to the same reaction of rage and anger. But especially what makes it bubble up and boil inside of me is a feeling of helplessness. Mostly helplessness to help others, or convince them to change/help themselves.

Some examples of times anger has most taken me over:

1. She kept falling, yet my mother in law's husband wouldn't allow her to use a wheelchair, walker, or cane. (#1 Anger: Trying to convince someone to do something good for them and not being listened to) Then she fell and broker her hip (#2 anger: repercussions of an unheeded warning ""I told you so"") 

2. I tried to get my husband to stop smoking cigars, but instead he just kept sneaking them (#1 anger: ""you aren't listening to me"") then the reprecussion, he got really sick (The #2 anger: I told you so) 

There's always the middle part of helplessness (OK I'll lay off) which is the part where the anger is just sort of boiling. I know I can't control people, and that thought just makes me want to cry. They listen to everyone else but me. I try to speak differently, I try to change my behavior, but in truth I want and expect them to listen to me. It's ego against ego. I feel validated in the anger/emotion, because they are legit hurting themselves. What makes it worse is the expectation that I am to have empathy after they in no way shape or form heeded any warning I gave. In fact, sometimes it becomes a fight where I am labeled the ""bad guy"" for even mentioning anything.

An exact example of this was when I was a child, and I thought I was very kindly telling my dad, maybe slow down on the drinking, and he literally turned around and lambasted me for ""being mean"".

I've never been listened to, no warnings heeded, not even by those closest to me, and there's always some sort of repercussion. My dad ended up driving through a fence with the kids in the car, not long after I had told him to maybe slow down on the drinking. 

So, I don't know... I'm overwhelmed with this feeling of helplessness.

God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can't control (other people)
The ability to change the things I can (myself)
and the wisdom to know the difference... (I know now, it's the difference between other people, and myself)

So what do I do? Be a hermit? That's where I've been going with it.
I understand the philosophy of accepting the person, but not the behaviour, and have been working on that as well, and forgiveness.

 

After forgiving my step-dad for the abuses he put on us as children, he actually did apologize. So, forgiveness works, but that was literally like 30 years later. What do I do when I'm smack dab in the middle of something? I can forgive them, but only if I'm away from the situation. 

How do I get away from my husband when he is sick from something he could have avoided? For better or worse...

It's these kind of scenerios that drive me absolutely batty and depress the heck out of me.

I was in EA last time, and it talked about how to have a willingness to change, I love change, I want to change, always for the better, but literally everyone in that group said ""Oh I hate change with a vengeance""

So that means that everyone that I speak to, not about their whole person, but about one thing they do that may be hurting themselves, now hates me, with a vengance, because I mentioned change to them.

I'm so depressed thinking about this.

How is anyone supposed to help anyone else in such a society? 
You can't help people who don't want help! But that's the kicker, if I love the person, and they don't want help, they don't want my help, or to help themselves, or change at all... now I'm supposed to support them once they get themselves hurt?

I liken it to someone about to jump off a bridge:
I (start of panic attack from seeing it) say ""HEY! Don't do that!""
Then they reply ""You can't tell me what to do! What a mean/bad person you are! F off!""
Then I, remembering that every advice I get is to leave others alone, leave them alone. Tell myself ""Well, at least I tried"" ..and lo and behold, they jump. 
Then they are in the water, screaming saying ""HELP! HELP! I JUMPED AND BROKE MY LEG AND CAN'T SWIM SAVE ME"" 
and here's where the rage kicks in... ""are you f'ing serious right now?"" 

Half the time I do step up and jump in after the fact to try to help, but the other half the time I say ""Nah, I'm not talking to you anymore"". Really, I don't know what I'm supposed to do, and all the advice I get is to never even warn people of impending doom in the first place, which, trying to take that advice would take some real getting used to. I don't want to lie and tell people they are behaving perfectly when really they are hurting themselves, nor would I want people to do that with me.

And it's not little things either, it's situations where it's like ""maybe you should really slow down on this thing that's killing you"" like usually having to do with addiction."	Anger	2022-06-17T17:50:56.000Z	Schnikies

misplaced hate	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	9	"I really want to talk to someone about these feelings, I feel like I have to get this out somewhere. 

I lash out a lot, and I've been pretty extremely passive aggressive. I was told by someone that one of my biggest problems was hate, that my hatred for people in general was causing my issues.

I resisted that idea, and I hated myself just for the idea that I was bad for hating people for a long time, but I finally just buckled down and thought about it: other people, why I hate them, why I want to lash out, put people down, push people away and dehumanize  them. That was a huge step, just acknowledging that it was in me in the first place, and not trying to fight it.

It went like this: I hate everyone. Why? They hurt me all the time and don't love me. 

So... what I really hate is being hurt, and not being loved. And I've been too avoidant of facing my thoughts to realize this. 

My own hate is the reason why I'm getting hurt. They are responding to ME.

I'm not really sure how this is going to shape up, but this was a pretty big shift in me, realizing I was wrong about the source of my pain. It's not originating from other people."	Anger	2022-06-17T03:12:00.000Z	Veilebekk

Gamer Rage by Partner	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	9	7	"My (M32) partner has a problem with game rage. He screams and smashes things. This is all sorts of games - shooters, adventure, even online chess and poker. 

After trashing the kitchen when he lost a poker game today, I’m looking for tips to calm down. He has a stress toy and that does fuck all. 

I’m a gamer, I get it. But I’ve never been so angry I’ve broken anything or screamed at the telly. I just stop playing until I’ve calmed down. It sucks seeing him like this and if I’m honest it’s a little frightening (I had a medical procedure today and was in bed napping, got woken up to him violently screeching at his computer for dealing him a shit hand).

EDIT: Sorry, adding more info. I’ve suggested he stops playing when he feels angry but he doesn’t want to stop. I’ve suggested he abuses his stress toy but he says it’s not satisfying enough. Can’t really lower the difficulty on online poker and taking his anger elsewhere just leads to him damaging things in other rooms. I have no idea what to suggest.

How to Control Anger Issues Stemming from Anxiety?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	11	19	"How do I control myself? I'm an absolute Bitch when my anxiety spikes and it isn't fair to the people around me. I get stressed and I get really angry, mouthy, and impatient. For example: Recently my mom helped me get a remote job because I needed to make money but can't drive, I struggle with parts of it, get stressed and turn into a vile cunt, snapping at her when she's trying to help me.

It's a pattern I've recognized for a while but can't seem to get a grip on. Every time this happens, I get really depressed right after, I think that I'm an awful person and that they have every reason to hate me and probably do (I never voice that because I don't want to manipulate and invalidate their feelings, they have every reason to be angry and hate me) . Then I get really angry at myself for getting sad in the first place, I don't have the right to be sad because it's my fault I can't control myself.

If I purchase a bean bag so I can just HAVE AT IT. Would that be unhealthy? Or lead towards unhealthier behaviours?  


Context: 22yo, Life was going AMAZING in the last 12 months for me and then: Recently diagnosed with a brain tumour after 5 seizures in 12 hours, life is basically put on hold. Lost my car 2 weeks after purchasing it, can't drive until a neurologist signs me off, etc. Lost 10kg in weight because my tongue was crushes in my seizures, can't workout and keep my body progress going due to possible stress in relation to the BTRE (Brain tumour related epilepsy). New medication I am on to assist prevent seizures has a drowsy and anger side effect which I can 100% feel.  


I am also a hypochondriac germ freak.

And I physically see him ""wash"" his hands for barely 2 seconds and barely covers his hands with water and then ""dries"" them using the towel in the kitchen then wipes his hands on his pants.

Failure today. Disgusted with myself.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	10	38	"Hey all. 

I’ve had my anger under control for about 3 years. No major outbursts. Today I fucked up though, and hard. 

I was at the gym, and when I came back out to my car, the landscapers had absolutely covered the front end in grass clippings. I had just spent 5 hours and about $100 in materials detailing the car yesterday, so I was pissed. On top of that, I hadn’t eaten yet today, and missed my anxiety medication yesterday. A recipe for disaster. 

I threw an absolute rage fit at the landscapers. I mean I just have looked like an unhinged maniac yelling at these guys. When I turned around I saw that someone was filming me, and that’s what finally broke me out of my fit of unbridled rage. 

I will almost assuredly be making an appearance on Reddit, Twitter or YouTube as some insane asshole yelling at gardeners. I will probably get doxxed and potentially lose my job. 

I immediately called to make a long overdue appointment with a therapist, as soon as I got done sobbing in the shower for a half hour once I got home. I’m so disappointed, ashamed and humiliated in myself, and I don’t know what else to do. This is the worst episode I’ve ever had, and it may have ruined my life. 

I hope to god this therapist is able to help me. It’s clear to me now that I’m mentally sick. What happened today was not a normal persons behavior. I’m terrified."	Anger	2022-06-13T23:42:56.000Z	TaskChoice4567
I'm worried about losing her	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	9	"Hi, I'm Male 21(random facts: been diagnosed with autism, depression and anxiety. I am not happy, I haven't been for years). Ever since I was very young, I always had a lot of anger for no reason(at least that's how it seems) and my parents just ignored it, I would get very angry at very little things, maybe they just thought I'd grow out of it, 
To this day I still get angry over the smallest things, if I drop something, anger, if I lose in an online game, anger.. I don't know of any way to deal with it.. it's just outbursts of swearing, shouting and hitting myself or things in my bedroom.

Recently I got an online girlfriend(LDR, I don't go out much IRL and am very happy with a long distance relationship. She is the sweetest girl, Honestly one of the cutest and best people I've ever met. She is the only thing that can make me happy nowadays)

When we play games together, I get angry very quickly and easily, I'm fucking terrified that I might shouting at her or direct any anger towards her. I genuinely really really like this girl and I'm scared I'm going to lose her due to my anger problems. 

I apologize for being angry around her, but I can tell she's upset from it, but it's not long before I accidentally take it all out on her or shout at her, and I never want that to happen, I'm trying so hard to hold back any anger when I'm around her but it's really hard.

Sorry if this doesn't make much sense or I repeat something, I don't normally make these kinds of posts, but I've been like this for too long and need to change for her, and myself.

Please, if anyone has even a tiny bit of advice, I would genuinely really appreciate it. I really want to change for the better for this girl.

I need some advice for managing my anger	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	I broke a piece of equipment at work today. Nobody knows I did it because no one was around when it happened, and I never said anything. I am hoping they just assume someone dropped it and don't look at the cameras, because if they looked at the camera footage, they'd see that I smacked it. It didn't fall or anything, I just hit it too hard. The screen is messed up. I am pretty sure we have a second one of the thing I broke, but still. I was running through the scenarios in my head immediately after it happened. It was one of those outbursts that happen without you even thinking about it, and you only realize what you just did after you have already done it. I don't know if I am going to be fired or if I'll have to pay for it or if they will even know/mention it, but I am shitting bricks. This is my first job and I really like it.

I got told I'm charismatic, and it blows my mind	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	2	"I've always been the most awkward person I know, if it's normal situation, boy can I make it awkward. Its just my go to, I feel awkward, so if I make it clear that I feel awkward no one else can tell me I'm being awkward. A defensive mechanism.

I had drinks with someone I've know since school (10+ years ago now), and I mentioned how awkward I am. And she said why, I said because if I feel awkward then I'll always be ready for when I make things awkward. 

What she said was interesting, while not entirely true (because I was drunk as hell) she said, I just act awkward because I'm charismatic. It somewhat made me feel really unsure, am I actually charismatic? When I say I'm awkward it's no lie, it's how I feel, what I feel I bring to a group.  She called me out, she said that I just say I'm awkward but I'm actually just charismatic and it's my way of dealing with that. 

I know it sounds pathetic, but it really hit me hard. Do people actually thing it charismatic? Do people actually think I'm awkward? I feel one, and apparently others see another. It's completely new to me that other people might see me as charismatic. And I'm not sure what to do with that information."	offmychest	2022-07-01T15:13:04.000Z	RHCPFlea

Dogs bark	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	I live on a dead end street in a small town in New Jersey. The neighbor at the end of the street is a seeing eye dog trainer, so walks her dogs multiple times a day around the neighborhood. This morning I decided to take our dog for a walk and called my mom while walking. When we turned the corner the lady was walking down the hill with her German shepherd and automatically crossed the street when she saw us coming. (No big deal, her dogs are in training and even if they weren’t, some owners don’t want their dogs interacting with others for various reasons). My dog starts to bark while we’re passing and the lady starts yelling nastily across the street that I need to control my dog and that I’m being extremely rude. Now just to set the scene again, we are on opposite sides of the street and my dog is on a leash. I understand that your dog is in training, but if you need complete silence and 0 distractions while walking your dog, NJ isn’t the place for you. I was caught so off guard and automatically became infuriated.

Was my family really that shitty to me? Or did I subconsciously choose to only remember the bad stuff? Am I just painting them as the bad guys in my mind?

Were they really all that bad? What if they were actually good, but I just only focused on the bad? What if I'm just looking for a reason to never see them again and to have a justification?

I remember disliking my aunt so much. I thought she didn't like me. She acted like it enough. But sometime during highschool, she just changed. Started acting all buddy buddy, like she actually liked/loved me. Never even acknowledged the shitty stuff she did. The same goes for my cousin and brother. My grandma also acted like that, but she never really changed. 

I just wish I never had to see them again. Well, my grandma's dead. So, 1/4?"	offmychest	2022-07-01T15:04:32.000Z	Defiant_klepto_4157

Taken from Wikipedia:

Under Article 24 of the National Basketball Association (NBA) Constitution, the NBA commissioner has the power to hand down disciplinary actions (either suspensions or fines less than $60,000) on players for on-court incidents, conduct that does not conform to standards of fair play, conduct that does not comply with federal or state laws, and conduct that is detrimental to the game of basketball or the league…

…If the incident is serious enough, such as point shaving or substance abuse, players can be permanently banned from playing, although players banned for substance abuse are permitted to be reinstated two years later under the anti-drug agreement between the league and the NBPA."	nba	2022-07-01T15:53:36.000Z	notlukadoncic

But yet here I am doing my normal duties plus taking on working on machines where electrical diagrams are needed. We haven’teven been offered classes on how to work on these machines , we are literally learning as we go. I’m fed up with this place and we all have now figured out that food service is making 2 more dollars a hour than our department. I’m fucking mad I hate this collage  they want people to be smarter to earn more money but I can’t even get a wage that helps me get by.

I hate that I am so empathetic, just want to stop finding excuses for people's shitty behavior.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	4	"I hate how I always believe that humans are inherently good. Like if they are doing something shitty, they are a victim of their circumstances. I can't believe even after so much shit,  I am finding excuses or rather reasons why someone could have acted in such a way. Somehow they never put them in my shoes. 

I hate that its just impossible for me to truly hate people, no matter how shitty they have been to me. And it's not just one. Like a lot of them. When they never bothered to understand your circumstances. You gain the respect of people, but oh well. How does that even matter? I do have those thoughts like karma or bad shit should happen to shitty people. But, then, quickly realise that it's wrong and it's so human to think that way. And that I need to strive to be something more. 

So disgusted with myself. Just wished I were like others who never care. But, I have found the reason why I am so empathetic. And I am on my way to cure it. Hopefully. Trusting the docs.

Lastly, I have deleted everyone in my contact list. Seriously everyone. As I said, shit was abysmal. So, going through this all alone. Listening sad anime music. Feels good kinda. Sometimes, I do wish to go back. Just forgive and have good times. After all, time is short. But, I remember I have tried numerous times and failed. Humans are shitty as always. There might be a few truly good ones. But, I am yet to find them. Have a feeling I'll just be alone forever. And that's ok. Not because I won't find people. But, i dont think I'll let them in. And not just love. Friends, family, everyone. And I am ok. You might not believe how can someone's life be so sad. But, trust me, there are people born to suffer. Or sometimes I do feel that I have high bar and that's what disappoints. Expecting people to be like me. Sorry if this sounds like bragging, but it's true. Phew. End rant.

I’m a virgin so I’m irrelevant and have no value	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	10	1	I feel like I have no value, especially around people my age. I’m a 19 year old male virgin, turning 20 soon. Because of my virginity, I shut down and avoid others in social situations because I feel so behind and inferior to everyone else in experience, like I’m not worth anybody’s attention or time. I just know that my pathetic nature would be quickly revealed to them even if I did initiate. I missed the chance of experiencing and experimenting with a vital part of teenage life and now, as an almost 20 year old, I am a misfit. I don’t belong. And it’s hard because I will never get that time and chance back at being a normal teenager. Every word that comes out of my mouth when I speak to someone feels completely invalid. Even my presence with others feels invalid because of my virginity. I think this because sex is such an enormous and casual part of life that is done so many times in teen years as a normal part of human nature. The fact that I didn’t do the most basic, universal and fun part of being a teenager fills me with an irreversible and extreme regret, shame, embarrassment, low self esteem, and has ultimately wiped out my value as an already 20 year old man. Having sex as a teenager sets you up for success because you develop that physical maturity, experience, and confidence, all while creating fond, coming-of-age memories at that. Having no experience in sex just sets me up for failure and degrades my value to nothing.	offmychest	2022-07-01T15:55:44.000Z	lanights2021

Perpetually Unlucky	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"I'm not sure how it is possible to be so damn unlucky, and no I don't mean being lazy and blaming a lack of preparation and action on luck. The stuff that happens to me I literally have no control over.

For example when I first moved into a apartment, it had a silverfish problem that of landlord didn't tell me about and now in my new place, there is a ant problem and springtail infestation. I literally have fucking ants in my room that I just moved into that has no food at all. Imagine finding ants all over your stuff 1 day after moving in and settling down. 

Next there is the thing that really pissed me off. The other day I was driving and went pass a green light, I'm the through traffic going straight and this was a 50mph zone. Now out of no where a car pulls out right in front of me from outside, essentially merging onto straight traffic without even looking. Imagine you are just driving straight and a fucking boulder appears out of no where, that is literally what it felt like. I had to brake and swerve just to avoid him, I really wish I got dashcam to show this idiot. And afterwards I just see him in my rearview driving extremely slow like 30mph holding up traffic behind him so this driver must have been impaired. If I hadn't been so quick to react that 100% would have been a really bad accident. 

The best part this isn't even the 1st time something like this happened to me within a year. Earlier last summer I was sitting in traffic at a red light when a van rearends me, I get him to pull over and he says his ""brake wasn't working"" I'm sure that is why he was able to brake right into the sidelines after hitting my car.

Next I was driving down a highway with multiple lanes and a pickup truck decides to merge right into my car, like go straight into my side without looking. ALWAYS LOOK AT YOUR BLIND SPOTS WHEN MERGING. Thankfully I had scanned my left side prior and knew there was no cars there so quick changed to the other side just as he was about to straight up go into me. Again my reaction time saved me from getting hit in the side. Oh why were you in his blind spot, well because I was following the flow of traffic and there were cars in front of me and behind me so I couldn't really go anywhere else I was wedged in both front and back. 

After all of this I think I'm going to start using a dashcam because I could honestly break a world record at this rate with how unlucky I have been with my encounters in 1 year.

Bad things beyond my control keep happening to me and I can't help but feel like I was cursed. Anyone else feel this way"	depression	2022-07-01T16:00:00.000Z	munchysenpai

My whole family is very depressed and having a hard time	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"These are very difficult times for me and my family.

My 92-year-old grandmother has Alzheimer's, and we are unable to deal with her. One night a few weeks ago she almost started a fire while we were sleeping because she wanted to put something on the fire to heat up, she forgot to turn it off and went to sleep. Good thing we had a fire alarm.

After several scares like this, my parents have decided to start the paperwork to take her to a residence. And she's having a hard time, when we went to see each other or she didn't recognize us or she started crying asking to go home. It is very hard for them.

My sister is going to have her second child and it is being a difficult pregnancy. My brother-in-law lost his job 2 months ago. He is a teacher and the private school where he taught was going to close, he had known for a year. They have been fighting for as long as they know it to be paid compensation, and they are in the process of trial, paying a lawyer among several companions.

Since he knew that they were going to fire him, he began to prepare an exam to be able to access a public official position, he studied many hours a day. He had the exam 2 weeks ago and has failed.

He is dyslexic and it has cost him a lot to study, he is very depressed.

I have the usual problems, greatly enlarged. I am alone almost always, I work almost 12 hours, I have problems with my bosses and I don't know what to do. I feel useless and stupid and that I am going to leave work very humiliated for not being able to finish all my tasks.

Our leadership/management is basically non-existent, I've been watching our developers get forced to work 24/7 over nights and weekends for the past 6 months + with no real direction, I have no real customers to interact with, and the worst thing is that our founders don't even understand our product or what it does. They have been pushing me into other areas of the business that I don't understand (I've been put in charge of invoicing clients, FFS and have no financial background) and when I tell them I'm not ok with it, it becomes a gaslighting festival.

Is this kind of par for the course at a startup? I really am feeling my mental health declining. When I started 4 years ago we were around 50 people, now we are at 24, we did a huge round of layoffs about 18 months ago and literally nothing has changed.

I want to walk away but the problem is, they pay me a lot of money for basically doing nothing ($80k/year.) My husband is in management at a very large company and does well enough where I could walk away if it really came down to it, but he is very unsupportive and tells me I have a cake job and I should just ride it out. I don't think I can. I am so close to breaking. I've applied for other jobs but now the feedback that I'm getting is that my current role is so broad (I have so many different things that I'm involved in at this point) that I am 'under-qualified' for everything.

I don't know if I'm looking for advice or what, I just need to get it out. Sigh."	offmychest	2022-07-01T17:18:56.000Z	startupsuck
Frustrated with work	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	I recently moved to another country to support some teams here for 3 months and the team here is very bad and they keep complaining even when I’m working more than 10h a day to finish  all the pending work here. In my tenure in my home country for 1y and 5m I had 0 complaints against me. And now I’m just 2months here I have 3 complaints. I regret coming here and it’s so frustrating to work with people who won’t even talk to me once before complaining that I’m not doing my work even though I am!! Thankfully only 1 month left here and I’ll be back home.	offmychest	2022-07-01T17:16:48.000Z	zorroce
Pros to being an anxious person	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	I recently experienced a terrible situation. I’m dealing with it. But I created a list of all the ways things could go wrong when I come out with the truth. And genuinely I had no problems doing that. That’s exactly how my brain works anyways. I’m pretty sure I’ve thought about every situation that could go wrong and ways I could navigate that. I’m thankful for myself today.	offmychest	2022-07-01T17:16:48.000Z	fayhigh
I hate Delta Airlines.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	2	"They lost my carry-on bag, if you can imagine, and sent it to Scotland. My destination was fucking New York! 

Now I’ve been without my laptop and drawing tablet (both of which I rely on for my job) for over a month, and haven’t been able to replace because now I don’t even have the means to do my job. My limited edition sneakers that I can’t rebuy were in there. My favorite clothes were in there, my shoes, even my jewelry.

All gone, sitting in a random airport in Scotland. And all they want to give me to reimburse me for all the shit I lost is $300. 

Fuck you Delta. Genuinely, fuck you. I hate these people more than anything right now. I don’t even know what to do anymore."	offmychest	2022-07-01T17:10:24.000Z	_Beef_Wellington_
Massage guns are the devil (I think, I’m not entirely sure).	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	2	My boyfriend, we’ll call him Bob, is 30 years old was diagnosed with CHF after undergoing surgery on his back due to a suspicious staph infection. He lost his eye sight in both eyes (detached retinas) which he’s had surgery for twice, the first being cataracts then the retinas. I believe the massage gun may be the culprit, but he doesn’t listen. He uses it everyday for HOURS at a time. He even uses it on his face. He brought them up one day because he has a severe amount of tension all over his body. It’s like his entire self is made up of stress knots. His face looks like he’s frowning even when relaxed. I used to massage his back for hours at a time and developed new techniques that would release the knots that would occasionally pop. Sometimes it’d be one after the other, imagine rubbing two big Legos together…that’s how it sounds sometimes. I feel for him tremendously but I couldn’t keep doing that with my day nearly everyday. So I thought a massage gun would be great. I thought it’d speed up the process of alleviation all the while he can do it himself. My God I regret backing that idea up. It’s there most harm I have done him in our ten year relationship because now he won’t let it go. I didn’t research it then and now that I have I hope it’s not too late. Massage guns can damage your organs, tendons, veins and so apparently LIVES too. I’ve told him his eye is literally all red and he shrugs it off because he’s “already blind”. It drives me crazy to hear the massage gun on for HOURS a day! It pains me knowing he might regret it one day and it won’t only be him crying about it. Over and over again I’ve pulled out the facts, read him the dangers that are documented online (because there aren’t many) and still he insists that I don’t know what I’m talking about. I just want to throw it in the microwave so it never turns on again. Or at least hide the charger. I still massage him myself every now and then but as soon as I stop to take care of something else, like a knock on the door or tend to our kid, he turns the massage gun on. He’s already looking a tad bruised up in some areas. The back of his knees don’t feel right (as he says) and just by touching certain parts of his back and legs even I can tell he can’t feel my hand there. I know he can’t actually see what I’m seeing so I have no way to tell him that something is wrong. He must feel something is off I’m sure but he neglects himself to the point of getting mad at ME for bringing anything up. I still do it everyday in hopes he’ll listen. It’s killing me inside everyday and I don’t have anyone to talk to about it other than the person who is going through it and will do anything (in this case being only using the massage gun) to feel some type of relief.	offmychest	2022-07-01T16:59:44.000Z	LUCXYZFER
what is going on with me? why am I not scared?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	2	"I don't know how I got here again, but normally right now with the sht that I am going through atm I should be panicking. However I am not panicking or even slightly anxious , in fact I feel at peace. I am so used to expecting fear, but now it descided to just leave me. I am extremely confused.


I remember being like this years ago, but never thought I would see the day were I was back here again. It's like finally being cured from a chronic illness or not having to carry a heavy rock anymore. I do have to be careful though, I can't just say nothing matters and do whatever I want.

I feel so lonely and lost	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	For the last couple of years, I (30 F) feel like I've been spiraling out of control. I recently graduated from college - after dropping out years ago - and I can't find a job anywhere (I have a part-time job, but I can't make a living out of it) and this makes me feel like a complete failure. All of my friends already have jobs and have moved out of their parents house, but I am stuck. I feel like I can't talk about this with anyone because none of my friends would talk to me whenever I bring the topic, or I try to talk about these feelings. I have listened to them whenever they needed to vent about their jobs, or a promotion that was stressing them out, their struggles, their love lives, etc. I'm a notorious introvert, so it's not like I bring this out a lot, and I have also struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts in the past. I feel completely lonely and lost, and I don't know how to deal with this anymore or how to confront them about this.	offmychest	2022-07-01T16:34:08.000Z	bibibang

I am angry for putting in so much effort and not receiving any emotional support.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	2	"I am angry. So angry I‘m crying right now in fact. My brother has always been a person who‘s mooching off your back and never put in much effort while my mom applauded his intelligence. “He has so much potential!” “He could get such good grades- he’s just lazy.”. No one ever outwardly said anything but I always felt the expectations to be better. To achieve more. So I did. I tried to get the best grades possible, to get a good degree but it all came to ahead a few days ago when I got so burnt out I failed and didn’t graduate- I got a second chance to re-do my math exam on monday though. So now to the main issue at hand, I am going to take my Cambridge Language Exam tomorrow and told my family how nervous I am. My brother refuses to join me tomorrow morning for mental support and my mom just told me she has other plans with our grandma. I was confused as I told her about the time she left me at an important competition 4 years ago and how I failed because I felt so abandoned and nervous and sad. I also told her I informed her about the date weeks ago and how disappointed I am.

No matter what academic success I have my mom always makes it about her and how much she helped me but none of this is true. I don’t care about monetary support. I just want someone to believe in me and to encourage me. I hate it."	offmychest	2022-07-01T16:27:44.000Z	cherryl3monade
I don’t feel like I belong	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	2	My friends are competitive with video games and for the majority of my life I’ve played casually. But over quarantine I got into competition with some of them and I do enjoy it! But I’m also very hard on myself. I’ve been in therapy for a while and am working really hard to improve the internalized negativity but I have my moments where I get overwhelmed or upset and either cry or step back so I can reflect and self soothe. My friends keep playing a lot and they keep getting better and I’m happy for them. But they’re farther ahead than me and the game won’t actually let us play ranked together anymore because of the difference in our levels. Last night I was invited to watch them play and initially I knew it would upset me because I wasn’t able to play with them- but I joined the call to try and learn something and see how well I could manage my feelings. I did learn some things but as I expected, I felt sad that I couldn’t play with them. I swear to god when I’m feeling low and want to talk to someone if any of them are playing their games my messages are pointless. They don’t get seen until hours later, if at all. I don’t have many people in my support system anymore so dealing with these emotions on my own has been hard. There’s 2 people that reach out to me often but I am not close with them and it is NOT a good idea for me to be close to them. I’m Long story, but it’s a danger to my mental health. I hate seeing these people who I don’t want to be close with reaching out in these low times.  I just don’t feel like I belong anymore.	offmychest	2022-07-01T16:19:12.000Z	clementinedaisy
Sorry I couldn't reply yesterday	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	4	6	"Hello. I'm the OP from yesterday that was convicted (tried to link to the original post, but subreddit rules don't allow it).

A lot of people had questions for me and were asking for more details of the case. I was intending to answer them, but unfortunately I didn't make it back in time before the post was locked. So I'm posting this now in case anyone still wants information. I can't be online all day, but I'll try to check back every couple of hours or so.

As someone mentioned yesterday, I do have my DMs turned off. I chose to do this as a preventative measure against any possible hate mail or threats, as I'm not in a good enough place to handle those right now. I'm sorry if you wanted to reach out to me directly. I'm immensely grateful to everyone that offered me words of comfort and support yesterday and am so sorry I couldn't reply to your comments individually. Also for the awards, which tbh I don't really know what they do, but I do know they are also a show of support and kindness.

This will probably be my last attempt to talk about this--at least on Reddit. If this post also gets locked or deleted, I don't plan to try again. Just not willing to put that amount of effort into something that's causing me suffering anyway. And in a similar vein--just so everyone knows--I am planning to probably delete these posts and this throwaway account within a week. My aim in posting here was to get this ""off my chest,"" and now that that has been done I'm not sure it's helping me to leave the story up here perpetually. Idk, I'm still deciding.

Thank you everyone that has been kind to me."	offmychest	2022-07-01T16:17:04.000Z	anon7956
Brothers Insanity cost me everything	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"Throwaway account

I’m sick of the feeling of isolation, in the past two years I’ve lost nearly everyone, i still have friends but they have different groups that they spend more time with than with the group i have left. The pandemic didn’t even factor in to my newfound isolation the family situation has been fucking rough, I’ve sacrificed my teenage years to steer the shitship that is my home through family illness, my brother literally going insane and I did all of this without ever asking for reward and what has come from it? Nothing that benefits me, during the time my brother was undiagnosed and untreated i spent all day, everyday in a severe state of panic knowing that at any moment I may receive that call letting me know he was dead or that he had killed someone else he blamed me for all of his problems, woke me up every morning for weeks on end trying to start a fight or lay new unsubstantiated accusations that he perceived to be rational. he broke through my bedroom door (literally) and his own. he would punch, kick and scream his way to his desired objectives while tearing me down in-front of my friends trying his absolute best to humiliate and degrade at every possible step and his campaign worked, no one outside my close circle wants anything to do with me because of sins i never committed.

I want out, i want peace, i need my life back but the damage is done - so i sit here alone, and miserable because I done the right thing by not embracing insanity and keeping my family together."	offmychest	2022-07-01T16:10:40.000Z	Stockimage11
I hate my niece	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	5	0	"She’s only 8 months but I dont like her. I hate that she won’t stop touching me or sleep for more than 30 minutes. I hate that’s she’s always whining and won’t stop touching everything I have. I’m not even sure I love her. I babysit her almost everyday a week and I see her on the weekends. She’s always around and it’s so frustrating because no one understands that I don’t like kids. They think it’s a joke but it’s true i hate them. I hate them so much. Sometimes I wish she was never born. I hate the way she can’t speak to me and doesn’t listen. She doesn’t know boundaries and she won’t stop grabbing me. I hate her. I don’t love her. I don’t feel anything other than dislike for her. 

I know it’s wrong and she’s only a baby but she ruined my life. I can’t even enjoy my summer because I have to babysit her and it sucks so much but I don’t want to tell my mom because then everyone will think I’m being a dick. I didn’t sign up for this, I hate my family for making me do this. It’s so emotionally and mentally draining. I already struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts, add the overwhelming emotions that come with having a screaming baby. It makes me want to kill my self.

Today I seriously thought about taking my life (but I won’t)	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	0	"I’ve been having a very hard time in just about every facet of my life. My relationship is a joke, my financial situation is not getting better, I don’t know where to go in life, I feel completely shut out of all my friends and families lives. I’m just tired of waking up to fight for I don’t even know what.

I thought about if I were dead my friends wouldn’t feel burdened by me. My boyfriend will probably be hurt for a little while, but he would move onto someone else soon after. My parents might be brought together do to my death. I don’t know I just feel like my death would be beneficial, like it might be sad for a little while, but then people will just say “at least he’s not suffering anymore,” and then proceed to move on and forget about me.

I feel worthless and it doesn’t help living in a country (U.S.) that agrees. I have all the wrong traits and genes to get by this life. I was not cut out for this world. I’m too kind, so people take advantage of me. I’m black so half the country hates me, and I’m gay so there’s another half of the country that hates me for that. Being both, in the eyes of them I’m a disgrace to world. It’s just tiring waking up knowing this is my reality on top of my personal demons.

If I speak out about some these issues I’m either pathetic, and just complaining, or in the words of some of my family “needing to man up.”

I came here because, really where else can I go? Therapy is expensive, and you have to shop around until you find one that “understands.”

I thought about really taking my life for all of these reasons, because I’m just human how much can one bare everyday until it might? get better.

I am currently not actively planning on doing anything to myself. These are just thoughts that are pushing suicidal boundaries.

TL;DR
I thought about ending my life because I feel worthless, and nothing is improving even though I’m doing everything in my power. However, I am not planning on taking action."	depression	2022-07-01T16:40:32.000Z	justemobro

I’m Tired.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	1	"I’ve had depression and suicidal thoughts since I was about 6 years old (yeah, it’s young I know but I had some horrible stuff happen to me so iykyk) because of my family, who’s way of coping with mental health/Illnesses is to just flat out ignore the issue, I’ve never had any treatment of any sort. The closest I came to anything like help was when I was about 15 years old and I told my father I was suicidal; resulting in my dad to allow me to take an antidepressant for all of maybe a month before calling me crazy and saying either I was a joke or the situation itself was. 

I’m 20 years old now, going on 21 in December, and I’m just so tired and so exhausted with life. I live with so much trauma that panic attacks and flashbacks of the trauma are a daily occurrence. I can’t get through my days anymore without drugging myself to the point that I’m nearly unconscious. I work a meaningless and pointless job as a waitress at a dying restaurant. I failed out of my college program and neither have the drive, the funds nor the mental security to return and finish it in the fall. My old hobbies, such are drawing, painting, crafting in general, fill me with nothing but boredom/nothingness. They honestly just feel like a chore. 

Basically, to sum it up, I have pretty bad depression and my life sucks. 

However, despite how bad things get, and how bad I know things are, I can never seem to bring myself to actually get help. I’ve reached out to people before, my sister, my dad, school councillors, friends, but it feels as if my efforts mean nothing. I try to call doctors to make an appointment but by the time I get through the normal 20-30 minute wait times they have I end up having panic attacks that render me unable to communicate at all (I mean I could scream and cry at them and hyperventilate for them but the most they’d get would be the rare word about me being unable to breathe) I go to therapy and the damn therapist says, and I quote, “don’t you think you are having a melodramatic reaction to it happening?” After being told about the times I was sexually, physically and mentally assaulted by my mother and her boyfriend. 

I’m just tired. I’m tired of this world that demands I move quickly through my trauma as if it didn’t happen and I’m tired of listening to the voices of people saying “it’ll get better” or “hang in there” cause frankly it’s not. 

I’m just so goddamn tired."	depression	2022-07-01T16:08:32.000Z	Anxious_Forevermore

I am looking for a computer game that I used to have as a kid	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	7	0	"Hi!

I am looking for a game I used to have on a CD when I was little. Last time I saw the disc was around 15 years ago, I think it was a game starting with H, a short title (I think around 5 letters, but I am not sure at all). It was a game about a knight, I think there was a white-blue painted shield on the main page. It’s all blurry, but I think I remember it looked a bit like a medieval Rayman in a way (not the character, just a general world idea). I was stuck very early on, at the gates to some sort of a castle.
I understand my explanation isn’t top tier, but that’s honestly all I can remember.

I'm so frustrated by Xfinity data caps that unfairly target houses that game	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	49	17	"Basically title, but I should not have said target, I should have said unfairly punish, but now I can't change it. I'm a dad who games. I have two kids who game. We like playing games together. Games like Ark and Call of Duty. But these games have massive downloads and massive patches that constantly update. Consider the largest game downloads:

* 275 GB: ARK: Survival Evolved with all the DLCs.
* 231 GB: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.
* 178 GB: Quantum Break.
* ~~165~~ 106.3 GB: Destiny 2: ShadowKeep.  (thanks, /u/D45HUNT3R)
* 165 GB: Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War.
* 150 GB: Red Dead Redemption 2.
* 150 GB: Final Fantasy XV.
* 149 GB: Hitman 2

The data cap for Xfinity is 1.2TB which sounds like a lot, and maybe it was plenty 5 years ago, but not anymore. It's 2022 Xfinity, it's time to do away with data caps that unfairly target gamers and people who use their own modem/router instead of your equipment so we  can get throttled.

You DO NOT want sentry in the mcu	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	21	0	"Seen a couple fan casts so let me just say how much of a terrible idea this is seeing as the mcu historically can’t write strong characters. 

Sentry barely works as a comic character let alone an on screen adaptation. 

He exists for two reasons. 

1. So writers can wank the villain they’re writing. 

2. They can wank sentry himself in the name of a spectacle. 

Literally it’s just “YAY SENTRY SAVED THE DAY.” “OH NO THE VOID!!!!.” “guess he won’t be the sentry anymore out of guilt and fear again.” X that plot by 5 then 

Oh cool the sentry and void merged that creates a fresh new dynamic oh shit never mind the next writer had him torn in half to show how cool the villain they’ve just created is. 

In a movie that just isn’t going to work. 

Realistically his character would make like two main appearances. For example play the hero in that rumoured WWH movie then a follow up appearance with the void then he’s pocketed until a villain needs wanked. 

There’s no point trying to build a character that would go absolutely fucking no where because as we’ve already seen the mcu can’t even handle base hulks power."	marvelstudios	2022-07-01T17:18:56.000Z	lelwood6_16

When we were told that this thing was a primodial being that fed on space and time, could supposedly erase any Timeline that the TVA sent to his way and alledgedly ended a MULTIVERSAL War, did anyone look back at the purple cloud with a mean face that only covers the horizon occasionally in episode 5 and thought: ""Seems a little tiny for that."" ?

I mean, Alioth couldn't even catch up to a car and let slip a fuck ton of survivors like the Loki variants but we're supposed to believe that it's some universe devouring superweapon ?

He served his purpose as the antagonist of that episode but I didn't get a sense that he was even a fraction as powerful as the show was implying."	marvelstudios	2022-07-01T15:06:40.000Z	Ccbm2208

Next thing you know, he’s going into the Quantum Realm, a place only one other person had ever been to before. He’s fighting Iron Man alongside Captain America. Then comes up with the idea to undo the snap and goes on a time travel adventure.

Doctor Strange MoM questions	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	4	"So I just finished my second watch, and just have a few questions that never seemed to be touched on during the movie. Curious if anyone had some insight.

1) Multiple times (at least three examples I can think of) Stephen uses weird dark magic that involves conjuring monsters. Twice during the fight with the eye monster (weird creature head, then monster hands to grab the light pole), and then once while fighting Wanda (hydra heads). There was even a dramatic close up on his face when using the hydras. It made me think of the What If…? Strange, but obviously that’s a different one. Also, this was before he ever used the Dark Hold. I don’t think he’s ever used magic like that before, and they never seemed to address it at all, so I was just wondering if anyone knew anything about it?

2) Mordo. We all thought the “Too many sorcerers” scene was a set-up to Doctor Strange 2, but clearly they decided to go in a different direction. When they encounter the Illuminati Mordo, Stephen explains that the one he knew snapped and devoted his life to killing him. So… did that all just unfold in between movies? 

Maybe I’m reading into things too much but I was just confused. Any info would be appreciated by my curious mind!"	marvelstudios	2022-07-01T03:33:20.000Z	I-Game-On-My-Mac

Question about Mordo and the Illuminati	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	5	5	In Multiverse of Madness, Mordo seems to have some knowledge about the prophesied Scarlet Witch. With all of his knowledge in the mystic arts, Mordo must have known this was a serious threat. Or did he? It's unclear how much he really knew about the Scarlet Witch. My question is... If Mordo knew about the seriousness of the Scarlet Witch, why didn't he just simply warn his Illuminati colleagues about this threat? Did he just simply not know how powerful this entity was? Or was this just poor planning on the Illuminati's part? Or down to just pure arrogance.	marvelstudios	2022-07-01T03:12:00.000Z	Fridaypalzer

Modded game streams?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	8	0	"I'm new to twitch, as per rules I won't advertise my channel, but I would like to know (just out of curiosity) if it's against the rules or frowned on to stream something like a private server or modified version of a game if i clearly define it as such.  


an example being Tarkov/EmuTarkov.  


If I publicly prove that I own the game, and proceed to use a single-player mod (EmuTarkov) to play offline, is that considered taboo? I understand Battlestate, in this situation, wouldn't approve. but in the case of other games (or including this one) is this something that I am allowed to do?

Paranoid about causing a scene or being banned. I appreciate any feedback, but I won't respond to sarcasm or unproductive witticisms.

"How does the ""Stream on 7 different days"" react to streams going from one day to the other"	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	4	0	If I stream over midnight, so one stream takes place on 2 days. and than later that day I do another stream. does is count as 1 or 2 different days? cause the second day might get cancelled out due to the first stream already falling on that day too. and as a follow up, can this mean that a third stream could not count too if the second similarly went past midnight. this is assuming midnight for the time zone twitch uses for this metric.

Need help improving Stream quality	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	12	2	"TLDR:  Been streaming for years, but as of late my quality has gone to shit,  with around 20minutes of every stream is just unwatchable, garbled mess.

But when I check OBS, it shows nothing is wrong

[ My last steam performance when they said it was unwatchable. ](https://preview.redd.it/w5qs71v1ss891.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab9d82584795e8e79ce65f9185a92b6ac18f8247)

My last steam performance when they said it was unwatchable.

I've  been streaming since 2015, and always had issues. When I tried  outputting 1080p, no one could watch it even though I had it at  6000-7000bitrate. So I lowered it to 720p 60fps with 5000bitrate and  it's been mostly fine

Then around  early 2020, things just started screwing up. A good portion of my stream  would be crystal clear, then rest unwatchable, or worse completely  watchable for some people and totally unwatchable for the rest.I love  half my user base during covid, dropping from 40-50 people a night to  10-20 at most, but I still stream because I enjoy it.

Now  a days, a good portion of my streams people bitch that it's  unwatchable, A laggy, frame jumping mess.. after 15-20 minutes it'll  clear out but by then anyone interested will have left and apparently  this has been going on for a while... and I want to fix it.

I live in a small town with Spectrum as my provider.

[ Current Spectrum stats](https://preview.redd.it/gnbthoi4ss891.png?width=1239&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb88a4edb6bf115d445deaae1aa9cbb332a4f76b)

However,  the connect varies greatly due to time of day, and weather. During the  winter, we seem to have quite a bit less bandwidth, and there are times  it feels like a strong breeze can take my connection out.

Heck,  I thought it was my PC's fault and built a brand new streaming PC this  year, and I am still having issue. Even switched capture cards.

What  the difference between the encoders x264, NVENC, and NVENC (new)?Before  using the Elgato HD60 Pro, I had been using an Elgato HD60 S which ran  through the USB Port (USB C to A). I learned it had no Hardware encoding  unlike the earlier models, so I sold it and purchased the PRO.

(The GCHD, HD60, and HD60 PRO all have hardware based  H.264 encoding, the 4K60 S+ has  HEVC/H.264  encoding)

**-MINOR EDIT -**

I just went back and watched one of the videos where people were regularly complaining about lag, horrible frame rate, and even freezing.The video on Twitch has no issues, nothing dropped and nothing lost. (Do I just post the video link with time stamp?)

So I don't know what it going on.

Capture Card Sound Crackling (OBS Studio + PS5/Switch, ElGato HD60 S)	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	0	"Greetings!

I am writing here as I have tried every possible solution I can think of. When I stream from my HD 60S to my PS5 or Switch I hear audio crackling. No matter WHAT I do, it always happens. It is immersion breaking, and makes creating content for console exclusives impossible for me.

I am looking for advice on how to fix this.

I have setup the audio as Capture Audio Only, WaveOut, ElGato audio as a microphone source on OBS, using the desktop audio and Game Capture software, as well as the 4k Capture Utility. No matter what I attempt to do, the problem persists. I have swapped cables, unplugged, replugged and even tried a different HD60 S. I am at a loss and have no idea what I should try next.

Indeed not showing assessments anymore?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"I am pretty sure that Indeed has changed their policies on showing assessments. 

I cannot view any of my assessments that I’ve taken in the past (even though there’s 10-15 of them that I’ve taken),

I know I am looking in the right areas of the website and the app. I have clicked just about every link, and looked through every page. 

I have tried deleting my resume and creating an ‘Indeed resume,’ but the tab to “show assessments to employers” is not there anymore, and it was DEFINITELY there as of a few months ago.

Unless this problem is exclusive to me, which I highly doubt it is, since I’ve been trying for days to get them to show up; and I am a very software inclined individual, I am positive the new policy is to ONLY show assessment results to employers.

Which is absolutely fucked. You’re telling me I could bomb an assessment, and there is no way for me to apply to that job without sending that test?

What about for other employers who require that assessment? I don’t get to retake? You’re just going to show the prior poor assessment results?

It's a pretty early relationship, but I don't want to end it just on that note and she has done alot for me already.... I'm just at a loss.

Another problem is there's another girl I started talking too at the same time of talking to GF (before titles were official) and I was interested in her more, but we didn't talk until literally yesterday. I feel my feelings stirred because me and other girl does have chemistry and I do really like her personality. I don't want to break up with my GF to be with her, but I feel very connected and bad that I never got the chance to date her instead....

This past week has been awful he keeps fighting us and biting us we explained this to their parents but they just say that he's a kid and he likes to play. But we don't want to play with him he continues to bother us and hit knowing that his parents won't care

I had to go to the bathroom to write this cus he keeps trying to hit me and his parents no longer believe me and I don't know what to do they keep siding with him and I am confused the parents once got me in trouble because I called him stupid after he called me a dumbass we told them that but they didn't care but when we call him stupid he goes to them and we get in trouble I don't want to stay here.

I want him out of my life they once asked me why do I not support my cousin the day after he made fun of my dead friend by copying me. The parents talk behind my back and judge me just because I don't like playing with the kid. Help me."	offmychest	2022-07-01T17:31:44.000Z	Fun_Light4441

Its nighttime and I dont want to increase my anxiety but my mother hasn't hugged me in years	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	My life's biggest regret, most painful element has been my strained relationship with my mother. Im 19 now and up until I was 16 , me , mum and dad were a cute lil family, it was perfect. Then everything changed. They fought. Mum cheated. started living separately, ugly divorce still on. But in the last 3-4 years, me and mum just lost our relation. Then i was told the truth, how she never wanted to have me and how i am the cause of her misery. I began hating me. Everything went downhill. She moved on, she has someone to talk to all night, to go party with. And here I am, lying numb in my bed, drowning myself in more pain, realising how mum will never hug me?

Why do people defend Nintendo?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	6	0	"Sure, they make good games, but they are ripping you off so hard it’s kind of sad. When you compare their pricing scheme to PS or Xbox, it’s so evident how hard you’re getting shafted. 

PS and Xbox both sell their consoles at around a 25-30% loss. The new generation takes about $750-$850 or so to make, and they sell for about $500-$650. The Switch costs about $250 to develop and they sell it for $400. That’s a mark up of 60%, that’s insane, that’s beyond fucked. 

When you compare controllers you see that the PS5 controller is $90, and it is undeniable that the PS5 controller is downright amazing. Nintendo is charging your ass $100 for joycons. Joycons are exceedingly well known for breaking, getting bad stick drift, and inconsistent connectivity. So if you want to get an actual controller, it’s another $90 for their so called “Pro” controller.

Games have certainly raised in price over the years, up in Canada is $80-$90 for a new release. The prices are that high on PS and Xbox because they need to make up that loss on the consoles, but they still have constant sales where you can easily find up to 80% off. Nintendo, despite up selling their console by 60%, still charge that same price tag, and they hardly ever have good sales, usually topping out at 50% for some random game you couldn’t give a shit about. 

I can buy a PS5 for $500 and get a subscription for $100 a year and I’ve got a shitload of games, and high quality controller, and they’ll all play absolutely beautifully. You buy a Switch for $400, a Pro controller for $90, whatever 1 game you want for another $80 and we’ve basically paid the same price, but I’ve got 1000x more content and power at my disposal. 

Genuinely, I fail to see any reason to buy a Switch with how egregiously overpriced they are. The Switch itself should be a $200 machine with $60 games and $40 controllers, joycons as well. If Nintendo is made for kids, make it at least a tiny bit affordable for fucks sake"	gaming	2022-07-01T17:29:36.000Z	gavinkenway

Trying to Turn Internal Hard Drive Into External Hard Drive, 'Request Failed Due to a Fatal Device Hardware Error' Message	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"Let me start this off by saying I'm not very savvy with this type of stuff, so I probably did something wrong that's very obvious. I recently got a new PC and I decided to try to take the internal hard drive from my old PC (Corsair One) and turn it into an external drive, to use with my PS5 for PS4 games.

&amp;#x200B;

I removed the hard drive from my old PC (Seagate BarraCuda TB HDD SATA, 2.5 Inch) and bought an external hard drive enclosure (WayLink USB 3.0 to SATA External Hard Drive Enclosure via Walmart). The hard drive fits perfectly inside the enclosure, the connector lines up fine. I plugged it into my PS5 and the light on the enclosure lit up, but it wasn't recognized at all by my PlayStation. I tried plugging it into my new PC (using a 3.0 USB port) and it showed up in disk management as disk 2, saying unknown and not initialized. When I try to initialize it, however, I get an error saying ""The request failed due to a fatal device hardware error"".

&amp;#x200B;

After doing some searching on Google, one result led me to trying to ""repair bad sectors"". I ran command prompt as administrator and typed ""**wmic diskdrive get status**"", which was supposed to tell me if the hard drive had any corruptions with the hardware itself. I got three ""OK"" statuses, which I assume were for my PC's internal SSD and internal HDD drives, as well as this external one, and according to the website I checked, that should mean there's no issues with the hardware itself. So then I tried ""**chkdsk F: /f**"", as well as ""**chkdsk F: /f /r /x**"", which the article said should fix the system errors. Both things got a ""Cannot open volume for direct access"" message. The article said to replace the F: with whatever drive letter the hard drive is assigned to, but it isn't assigned to any letter, because I can't initialize it in the first place, which is the whole issue here.

&amp;#x200B;

The only other thing I could find to try was to run ""**diskpark**"" from the start menu and type ""list disk"". It showed three disks, disk 0, disk 1 and disk 2. Disk 0 and disk 1 appear to be my C and D drives, as expected, and then I'd assume disk 2 is this one, but it shows as having 0 B of space. I then typed ""select disk 2"" and then ""clean"" and it said ""DiskPart succeeded in cleaning the disk"". Then I tried to initialize it again, but I got the same fatal device hardware error message. So, I don't know if there actually is something wrong with my hard drive (possibly from when I removed it from my old PC, although I followed a video guide showing how to do so and it seemed like I did everything right, and it definitely worked prior to that) or I'm doing something wrong with this external hard drive enclosure or what the issue is."	techsupport	2022-07-01T17:31:44.000Z	McDickLick

HELP! I need a camera whizz, time sensitive!	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"Hello! I have never posted here before so excuse me if this is too long or not long enough! 
I am currently trying to work on a present for a family member's birthday by transfering the contents of all of their old Mini DV tapes onto my computer and compiling these into one big video file so she can watch them whenever she like, and not on an old camcorder screen!

However, I have been running into several issues along the way, the most recent being that as of this afternoon (UK time) the camcorder (Panasonic NV-DS29B is no longer switching on at all, whether to record or to playback. The worst part of this is that it means I cannot get the tape with the footage that I was trying to work on out of the camera. 

So far I have been unable to transfer any footage as tracking down appropriate software and cables that work with a late 90s camcorder has been tricky, but I think I finally have it... if I can get the camera turned on.

When connected to the mains through the AC converter that came with the camera seemingly no power is drawn, however the battery charging light on the same AC converter still works like new and the battery charges, but then as soon as the battery and camera meet - nothing. I don't know if perhaps somehow I have knackered the internal battery somehow or if I need to give the external battery time to charge the internal or something, but this is a relatively urgent issue!

After tripping a circuit breaker, only Google-owned websites will load.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"Last night, I tripped a circuit breaker, cutting off power to my router, modem, and pc. After resetting the breaker and turning my pc, router, and modem back on, I noticed that I could only connect to Google and YouTube. I tested a few other Google sites and found that they worked as well, but Amazon, Reddit, and a local grocery store’s website were all non-functional. I forget the exact wording of the error, but it was something like “cannot connect to the website”. I know this is an internet problem and not a pc problem because I have the same issue when connecting to wifi on my phone.

I’ve tried resetting both my router and modem several times, the final time leaving them both unplugged from power overnight.

I restarted my pc several times.

While troubleshooting I found that there was an issue with a recent Windows update regarding wifi hotspots and people were suggesting that that update be uninstalled, so I tried that.

I tried everything on this page: https://robotpoweredhome.com/only-google-and-youtube-work-internet/ except I have not yet called my isp. Changing my DNS had no effect. Restoring my firewall to default had no effect. Restarting my browser or trying a different browser had no effect. Resetting my TCP/IP had no effect. Attempting to diagnose my network adaptor immediately gave an error; it didn’t spend any time loading or attempting to diagnose, just clicking diagnose immediately opened a box saying something generic like “there was an error trying to run diagnostics”.

I tried disabling IPv6. Nothing suggested this, but I saw a site mention that some sites use IPv4, and some use IPv6. So I figured I’d see what happened when I disabled it. It just made YouTube stop working.

One thing that I meant to try but just forgot is to connect with a VPN and see what happens.

The plan is to just keep googling and trying to find a solution when I get home from work later, and if I can’t to try calling my isp tomorrow. But if you guys have any suggestions beyond what I’ve tried, I’ll gladly try them out later tonight.

I did see a Reddit thread that mentioned some isp’s will restrict your traffic to certain websites if you’re caught torrenting, but I haven’t ever downloaded any files illegally (and also none via a torrent) on this particular internet connection so I don’t think that’s it.

Edit: I have Spectrum internet, and when I checked the My Spectrum mobile app last night, it said there was an outage affecting TV service expected to be resolved at 1am. I assumed this was irrelevant to my problem because it’s a TV outage and because I tested my internet again this morning, after 1am. But I just checked the app again and it says there’s a TV outage expected to be fixed today by 2:30pm. Do TV and Internet share the same transmission cables? Is it possible that this TV outage could somehow also block all non-Google websites?"	techsupport	2022-07-01T16:49:04.000Z	SgtMcMuffin0

Netflix won't display correctly on my Lenovo laptop	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"This subreddit has helped me before, and as I am a disaster with technology, I'm hoping it can help me again. Thanks in advance! I'm also not sure what to flair this as. I'll put software. If that's wrong let me know and I'll change it!
Basically, when I try to play Netflix on my laptop, all of the colors are black, blue, and red. I don't know how to attach a video to show it, but if I post it somewhere, I'll see if I can link it. I restarted my laptop, and the colors were fine again, but once I paused it everything went back to the way it was. Whenever I try to look up information about this, I'm directed toward things about LGtvs (again I am on a lenovo laptop, in windows 10 I think???). The issue doesn't occur on any other streaming service, only Netflix. The only other thing I found was a potential issue with- I think it was stereoscopic 3D or something?

MemTest86 failed for too many errors, what's next?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	15	3	"I've received some advice on here to do the MemTest86 to try to diagnose why my PC keeps getting BSOD. 

It has failed for too many errors for all instances of using both my RAM sticks and each one individually. 

My buddy, who knows computers, said there is little chance that both the RAM sticks failed at the same time and it could be my motherboard. The motherboard I am using did have an issue with one of the PCEI slots when I first got it. I just went ahead and used it with the working slot for my graphics card. So I wouldn't doubt that my motherboard could be the issue. 

I guess I just need to know what the next steps are or what I can to do figure out the next steps. Is there a way to diagnose if it is truly a motherboard issue versus a RAM issue?

I just want to get this PC up and running already!

BB golf Leaderboard update (Yankees... still)	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"I will continue to post this pointless nonsense because I think it's interesting and others might as well.

Yankees are killing the top spot 6 stokes under the second place team, the Astros.  12 under holding with a par hole 8 and currently have 3-1 on hole 9 (5-4 to par).

Mets and Astros are duking it out for second place with 6 unders.  Mets had a par for hole 8 and the Stros had an eagle.  Dodgers are hanging around also with a 5 under and a birdie on hole 8.

&amp;#x200B;

At the bottom, are the A's at #30.  Consistently terrible.  +17 right now and will only get worse.  The last 3 holes, the A's went triple bogey, quad bogey,  triple bogey.  On hole 9, they are already 2-4 with three games to go.  They win 3 in a row, they save par.... but history isn't on their side.

Then my Reds.  They had a flash last month and moved up to 27th but now they're back to 29th and consistently garbage.  Just....terrible.  +1, +2, +2 the last three holes respectively.  It will only get worse after the break when they start trading away key parts of their rotation (Castillo &amp; Mahle) and lean on AAA player more-so than they have already.  It's gonna get really really ugly.

Thanks for reading.

I think almost everyone knows the DJs. Be it via TikTok, Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts. They basically create mashups of songs fitting a certain theme and upload them while going through the cliche DJ moves like jumping around and flailing with their arms.

Guys like this: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CfKW4lZJIdu/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=

This seems fairly harmless to me, with these guys just wanting to broadcast music they like, but everytime I go into one of their comment sections I see barely anything but hate. Sometimes it's just calling the playlist cringe (understandable if it's not that person's type of music), sometimes it's near-bullying of the DJ in question.

What is up with Lightyear being heavily review bombed on IMDB?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	33	4	"So I check IMDB fairly often so I have an idea of what a typical rating is. The majority of notable movies falls somewhere between 6.0 to 8.0 with above 8.0 being a very positive rating and below 6.0 being a very negative rating.

[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10298810/?ref\_=tt\_rt](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10298810/?ref_=tt_rt)

Lightyear currently has a 5.3, which is pretty terrible. Checked the stats and 14,000 ratings (42% of total) are 1/10 so it's obviously being review bombed but I'm surprised to what extent. Even Captain Marvel, probably the most infamously review bombed movie I can think of, has a 6.8 overall rating and 32,000 1/10s which is only 6% of the total.

I haven't seen Lightyear myself but it looks pretty inoffensive, it has 75% critic score and 85% user score on Rotten Tomatoes so it doesn't seem to be hated everywhere on the internet. I've seen crazier low scores before but those usually regress towards the mean within a few days, Lightyear being this low after 2 weekends is unusual.

What’s up with the moderators banning comments on the “spoon trick”?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	90	993	"I saw this thread about a woman who is 17 and being forced by her family to travel back to Yemen to get married. The moderators pinned a comment telling people to stop suggesting the spoon trick or they’ll get banned. If I’m understanding what it is, the spoon trick is supposedly where you hide a spoon in the private area to trigger the metal detectors at the airport, so security can be made aware of the situation and the victim can share details of their incarceration. This seems like a reasonable suggestion to share with potential victims of human trafficking and forced marriage. My question is why would moderators want to ban users for suggesting this option to potential victims? Aren’t the moderators enabling human trafficking and forced marriage by not sharing this life saving tip?

After his first year playing in Seattle, he saw how the owners turned their back on an entire city.

What are the outcomes you want to see from the inevitable CBA negotiations?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	57	3	"Let's face it: a lockout is bound to happen, especially after all the stunts that the likes of Small Game James, Street Clothes, Bus Rider, Half-Man-Half-A-Season, and literal B.S. pulled off these past few years. I am not exactly against player empowerment, but have these few players ruined it or what? I feel bad for most of the NBA players because their livelihoods could be compromised by a few talented yet entitled players who think being good on the court means they can effectively either run the franchise or hold it hostage if their wants (not needs) are met.

What outcomes do you want to see in the new CBA? For me, I'd like to see two things:

1. Max-contract players who ask for a trade with at least two years left in their contract should be punished by losing at least 50% of their salary when traded, with any team receiving that player in the trade having the actual max-salary counted as double in the calculations for the luxury tax. 

2. The gap between the annual salaries for a max-contract and whatever is next to that should be increased, while still giving teams that drafted such players an advantage.

He’s involved in this premature trade scandal which blows up and costs the team draft capital. He ends up still playing for the team that tried to trade him, and wins a championship with that team but barely plays because of injury. 

Later in then next season the team that tried to get him earlier finally does trade for him. He plays poorly and it becomes publicly known he’s unhappy after only half a season. Then the Kings don’t even keep him as an RFA and he signs as a rotation player with a top contender.

Giving two week notice when I’m working only one day a week (part time, and resignation lettervia email 😞)	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	1	"Hello all. 

I don’t want to burn any bridges and honestly I love where I work.  I just can’t manage the school/work balance with the hours at this job (12 hours shifts, medical field) and for health reasons coming up.  I am part-time, usually one day a week. The schedule has been released into September, but I don’t work August because I asked for time off due to health reasons.  Well, my health reasons became more critical.  I have surgery scheduled for the the 7/15.  

I am scheduled for the next Sunday (7/10) and the Sunday after (7/17).  I want to resign tomorrow via email (unfortunately I cannot go in person, managers won’t be working those last two days). Technically it’s two weeks, I guess? 7/17 would be the day after “two week” notice.  To clarify, I want 7/10 to be my last day.  **Is this still technically a two week notice if I notify them I will not be working 7/17 two weeks in advance?** I really need this surgery and will be in recovery on 7/17.  

How can I be professional about it? It’s an odd situation and feel terrible already.  It is a terrible idea to give a short notice  or should I just reschedule surgery? Is it unprofessional to mention my health along with school/work as a reason for leaving? I loved where I worked but I do need to leave.  

Is it also unprofessional to do so over email? I cannot come in person to deliver a letter two weeks in advance, but if I wait to notify until my “last day” really it seems shitty for me to do so in person, only on my last day, since I only work one day a week.  

Thank you all."	jobs	2022-07-02T04:05:20.000Z	Ok-Dig0
SF gaming tech company lays off hundreds weeks after CEO suggested no imminent layoffs	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	2	"I feel bad for the people getting laid off, but this lie is the oldest one in the book.

Why do people make job search sound like its so easy?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	4	1	"Hi everyone!

I hope you all are well. So I have been job searching for over a year now.I have a part-time job, and I'll be honest—I'm ready to quit. I've found that my current employment has given rise to a lot of insecurities because of the toxic work environment. My supervisor believes that despite having an MBA and years of experience, I don't know how to accomplish anything. I oversee the general ledger, payroll, certified payroll, payables, receivables, and certified payables. Since many of the company's employees are located out of state, I also have to obtain all necessary permits and licenses.By the way, I work for a construction firm. I never imagined working for a construction company, but it was the only offer I received, and I was desperate for a job during COVID. But this job has been mentally and emotionally draining, so I'm trying everything I can to find anything else. All of my college friends have found jobs that will further their careers, yet here I am, still riding the struggle bus. I usually hear ""getting a job isn't that hard,"" ""You must be doing something wrong,"" or ""this... or that person found a job in a month"" when I speak to friends or family members. It's frustrating, and I don't think anyone understands how it feels. Its not easy- every rejection has made me upset, and after interviews I have had my hopes up only to be rejected. Companies have either rejected me, taken down the job posting, or have extremely low salaries (like minimum wage). I suppose I'm just venting because sometimes you just want things to be simple but they're not. I went to college with high hopes of receiving my Bachelor's and then my Master's, but now I feel as though I'm confined in a box while everyone else I know is evolving. Even though I should never compare myself to others, the urge to do so is only natural. Currently looking for a job in the consulting or bio-tech industry. If anyone has any tips, or advice I would greatly appreciate it. For all of my job search buddies I know its not easy, but will get something hopefully!"	jobs	2022-07-02T02:35:44.000Z	lolastarz99
Can someone explain using a staffing agency as a job seeker?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	7	5	"I'm still a bit confused and it's hard finding straight answers online since they explain it from the company's point of view of whether they should use an agency to help with recruitment. 

Are staffing agencies / employment agencies / temp agencies / search firms the same thing?
Like Robert Half, Adecco, Kelly, etc? Or are there nuances between these terms and firms?

How does pay and benefits work for the different types of roles like temp-to-hire, contract, permanent, etc? 

What type of positions are structured in that the agency takes a % of the pay from the employer before the worker gets their pay? What scenarios will the employer pay a lump sum at the beginning? 

When listing your employer, what scenarios would you say you're employed by [staffing firm] at [company] (like employed by Adecco at Google) vs. saying you're directly employed at Google, for example? 

Hope these questions make sense. Thanks in advance!"	jobs	2022-07-02T00:57:36.000Z	confused2021_

Landing interviews but can’t seal the deal due to lack of experience	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	21	3	"Been applying for two months to data analyst positions. While I have been getting interviews and making it through to the last round I have been getting rejected over and over due to lack of relevant experience.

Obviously, this job has very little to do with data analysis but I do have a BS in Mathematics as well as a decent portfolio of projects.

I feel stuck, can’t get a job because I need experience and can’t get experience because I need a job.

Trying to decide if I need to pivot to something else or go back to school and do a coding bootcamp or masters. Still, feels like education is just delaying the inevitable as I will still need experience either way.

A data scientist position is the goal but right now I just want a job semi related to it.

What to say if my boss asks if I'm job hunting?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	5	2	"The company is requiring us to return to office in a month because of a government mandate (I'm not in the US).

If I report to office, my only mode of transportation here is crazy expensive; it's gonna cost 20% of my daily salary.

So when my boss asked if the return-to-office mandate was enough to push me to look for other opportunities, I just gave a vague ""I don't know yet, I'll have to check"". My other boss also asked the other day but we shifted to another topic after I waited for him to say anything else.

I might get fired from my first job	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	6	0	"

I work in web dev and digital marketing and this is basically my first real career job since I'm only 22 years old.

I beat the odds by getting this job, it's a highly paid mid level marketing and web developer position while I only have some experience with freelancing here and there.

Now this job is amazing for a more established marketing specialist, since you work on single projects by yourself with no micromanagement and minimal oversight, highly flexible. 


But as a fresher it's been a struggling uphill battle, I basically work on projects alone with no collaboration and few oversight. We use a no code cms but the complicated intricacies of  navigating these projects and delivering a comparable product has been difficult.  


I've been there for a month and a half and I feel like my time is running short. I make alot of fundamental mistake, some are rote things that I forget but other mistakes I possibly cannot foresee at my skill level. A client recently complained that the project I gave them is way worse quality than websites other team members have completed, even sending a side by side comparison of the work he got and a website done by a more experienced member.

I've attracted alot of eyes on me now and started getting questions on my past work experience, I'm not anxious anymore. I've made peace with the fact that my time is almost up but I cant help but feel what a depressing and embarassing situation where I'm possibly getting let go after two months

Want to watch Mad God, but I am sensitive to gore and violence.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	5	0	"I enjoy sculpting macabre toys, drawing spooky and gothic stuff, and creating gaming content along those themes (miniatures, diorama, resin toys, rpg zines, cardgames, etc). It's been my thing since forever.

Phil Tippett's MAD GOD strongly feels like something I should watch while its in the theatres, because it's so relevant to my hobbies and passions.

I have always loved and been fascinated by horror (existential horror, cosmic horror, and sci-fi horror more so than gore and serial killers and stuff like that, which I generally shy away from), but generally in terms of novels or stories, as opposed to video games or movies.

Unfortunately, I dislike gore. And as I got older, I dislike it even more and more. I am not much of a horror buff film-wise, and I am not interested in being scared at all, but rather, I like horror for their characters, setting, themes, and designs (I like every other genre along the same criteria really)

Just about the most disturbing horror I have watched is Antichrist by Lars von Trier. I don't know where Hellboy (2019) ranks in terms of gore, but I have watched it and stomached the few grisly scenes it has. I enjoyed Prometheus immensely (for its theme and design) and did not find it scary at all.

People say MAD GOD is disturbing or disgusting. But I don't know what that means really. In what way does it disgust people? Existential/Cosmic horror is something I can handle. Excessive gore or extremely disturbing content, I really don't want to experience it.

Compared to Antichrist, Hellboy, or Prometheus, where does Mad God falls? Is it all about the gore, or is the theme why it truly disturbs people?

Would I enjoy watching this?"	movies	2022-07-02T06:58:08.000Z	justonky
2 Days in the Valley is a solid, but sort of weird movie.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	11	8	"I think this is a solid B- movie, its just kind of all over the place (which is sort of putting it lightly). It's got a solid ensemble of great character actors, with Danny Aiello and James Spader leading the movie as the main protagonist and antagonist. Its funny, sometimes intentionally and sometimes unintentionally, dark with heavy moments of drama, and swings back and forth rapidly.

Danny Aiello is a lovable washed up hitman who has a troubled past that's only really ever hinted at (he's been delivering pizzas lately), and for most of the movie he's holding people hostage, gun to head, menacing them, and then suddenly he's slipping into a weird kind of buffoonery with his fear of dogs and constantly falling off hair-piece. 

Then you have Paul Mazursky whose a failed and suicidal writer/director trying to give his dog away so he can shoot himself at his mothers grave. And these scenes are genuinely sad and emotional and a fucking massive whiplash after watching sociopathic James Spader talk about how crazy he would go if another guy touched Charlize Theron's boobs, and Danny Aiello holding a gun on Greg Cruttwell with his (Danny Aiello)'s pants down after yelling about a weird human faced dog sculpture. 

Overall, like I said it's a good movie. It's not convoluted and has a nice sense of dark comedic timing, it just feels weird at times because its very random. At one point Michael Jai White is stealing a car at a gay bar, and then he just goes and picks up (literally) Greg Cruttwell off the street where he's withing on the ground from kidney stones and then drives off and that's that. You never see White again, just Cruttwell talking about getting dropped off at the hospital. Then you have Jeff Daniels who plays a racist, recently divorced Vice detective who just disappears from the movie entirely about 65% in, making his character ultimately pointless. Weird, jumbled and messy, but I still really enjoyed it. On amazon prime if you wanna check it out."	movies	2022-07-02T01:04:00.000Z	Adrenochrome93

I remember when I was a teenager my sister attempted to stab me and it hit me that her behaviour was far from normal levels of teen angst. Her behaviour had become so normalised in our family. After that, I told my mom I think my sister is abusive to both of us, and she said it was absurd and ridiculous because ""siblings fight, it's not abuse"" and ""kids can't be abusive to their parents"" so I just bottled up my feelings for 10+ years and told myself that I was wrong to feel like I was abused.

Now, a decade later, to hear someone, a mental health professional, validate what I have kept inside all these years is both liberating and kind of devastating."	offmychest	2022-07-02T13:45:36.000Z	testies2475

Emotionally abused	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"I need somewhere to vent, to rant it out, to just scream everythjng out but yet at the same time I cant, I feel damn hell exhausted and suffocated. I don't know where to begin neither do I have people around me that I can share with and this is driving me seriously insane. 

I feel alone even when I am with her physically for the most days. Things that I told her, she either wait a few hours later and talk about it again and either get it all wrong or misunderstands me. And when that happens it's anger first instead of calcification. Throughout this 2 years it has always been anger first. 

I did something wrong, I apologisedz she said she forgave me, she asked me to explain, I double check with her whether she wants me to explain, she said yes and the next day she rages at me for trying to justify my actions.

I do it I never say my friend I always give her a name so she doesn't overthink but she still says friend or whatever each and everytime which has me overthinking always thanks to past experiences. I've told her multiple times to say a name but yet she keeps on doing the same thing saying that she forgets or that she's not use to doing it. She never fixes it and I'm always clearly upset after.

I’ve had a controlling father ever since i was a kid. 
Growing up i didn’t have much luck with my mentors either as i would get accused of things i never did which would result to them calling my parents to the school and then my dad beating me up when i was a kid. (It’s pretty common where i live) 
Over the years, i stopped talking to them and i didn’t realise how i just stopped talking to them.

I think I am finally broken by loneliness, its getting too much to bear for any longer.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	5	"tw: suicide

I am a 22-year-old straight guy. I have been in a single relationship for 2 years that was manipulative, emotionally abusive, &gt;!and made me almost commit suicide!&lt;. It ended a few years ago, and thankfully I didn't and I am still here. However, my mental health has never really fully recovered, and although I try to hide it, inside I am in so, so much pain. 

I have no siblings. My family lives hours away, and I have maybe 1 good friend that I struggle to stay in frequent contact with. All my other friends have either not bothered to stay in contact, or I have lost through other means.

Essentially, besides my parents, I have no one to talk to in person with. I don't want to open up to people because I know they cant help, and I don't want to burden them with my problems. I also feel like a worthless piece of shit because I'm told by society that as a guy you shouldn't be struggling, and showing that makes you weak, so I just bottle everything up and go on with my day.

But I cannot bottle it up anymore, I have no more space for it, and I am at breaking point. Despite the fact I am in therapy and medicated for my ADHD, I cannot shake the feeling of being so incredibly fucking lonely, and it hurts me more than any abusive relationship could.

I have tried to date online as I am chronically shy, and the thought of going somewhere and having to introduce myself to a girl I like scares me out of a crippling fear of rejection. Of course, as an average-looking dude with no friends and uninteresting life, I stand no chance of finding anyone. Out of the maybe 10 or so matches I have had over the 3 years, all of them will either match with me and I hear nothing or we talk for a bit and then they ghost me, never to be seen again.

I'm tired of feeling worthless.

I'm tired of feeling like I will live my life alone, and die with no one around me.

I'm tired of feeling like I am the problem.

I'm tired of feeling like nothing I ever do matters, so what's the point?

I'm tired of feeling like everything I try is fruitless.

I'm tired of feeling like I will never be able to enjoy life if I am alone.

I'm tired of feeling like no one will ever love me.

I'm tired of feeling like a burden to everyone around me.

I'm tired of being rejected by everyone I meet.

I'm tired of being the only one who has to put everything I have into maintaining a relationship with someone I know doesn't care.

I'm tired of feeling tired.

Most of all, I'm tired of feeling lonely.

Maybe this is just how it's meant to be? 

**Maybe I should just be alone.**"	offmychest	2022-07-02T11:18:24.000Z	throwaway0323425123

My mother won’t stop being sexual around me.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	8	7	"I’m a minor. My mom and dad got divorced 2-3 years ago and my mom found out she was a lesbian. Ever since, it’s been downhill. With one of her girlfriends, I could always hear them having sex in her room. Whenever I broke down and told her it made me super uncomfortable, she seemed annoyed and said that she had to deal with stuff like that when she was younger too. Now she makes it a point to bring up that she had sex. Whenever she has a “lady friend” over, the morning after (if they had sex) she asks me, “could you hear us last night?” and acts all annoyed. When I tell her no, she says that it’s good and they were trying to be quiet.
It’s random too. I’ve been relaxing in her bed recently because my bed has an ant infestation and they keep biting me. She has a vibrator in between her headrest and her mattress. She doesn’t even try to hide it, just keeps it plugged in so if I accidentally followed the wrong wire I would find it. She knows I chill in her bed too, and she hasn’t moved it. Once, as a joke, when she came to make me leave her bed so she could go to bed, I told her “I farted in your bed”, because I did, and I wanted her to laugh. She just looked at me and went “okay, well I had sex in my bed last night,” and I felt so disgusted. She keeps walking around naked even when we have the back door open and when I tell her to stop, she says that people should be thankful they get to see a “hot blonde lady”. It’s so uncomfortable. Everyone says the puberty talk is embarrassing, but the “asking your mom to stop being sexual all the time” talk is going to be 10x more embarrassing."	offmychest	2022-07-02T10:44:16.000Z	IceIsTrash

I've tried talking to them and they do not listen. And I'm running out of ideas to try and out of fight to the point of the subtle thought of suicide that were few and far between are now a constant and looking like the only way out.

I dated a sociopath and it was pretty intense. She has a body count.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"I don’t want to stigmatize mental illness. A person with antisocial personality disorder is a person. It was such a crazy experience. She was constantly testing my reality. Gaslighting me, turning people against me for fun. Making people hate me because she was bored. My dog got poisoned and it cost me like $5000 to keep him alive. I cared about her because I saw her as a victim of a mass shooting but now I’m starting to think she instigated that shooting and didn’t realize it would get out of hand. I think that really put her over the edge. 

I just had to get that off my chest. I don’t know how to feel. I don’t know to feel compassion or hate. Her family knows she’s kind of psychopathic. Even if you’re a girl that is kind of psychopathic and toying with a person and they go on a shooting rampage and kill people I don’t know if it’s your fault. Maybe you thought you were just playing around. 

I’d like some help making sense of it. I don’t expect much from Reddit. I’m just pouring my heart out. I’m not trying to be any sort of way. Thanks for your input.

I have struggled with mental health issues for a long time and after being put through the wringer by her and the flying monkeys I actually feel like she did me a favor.

My friend used my past against me.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	7	1	For context my (20f) friend (19f) both had very hard past few years. We both sufferd from depression and it was hard to stay friends. There was a lot of ups and downs. In that time I had one boyfriend who was really mean and a total ah but I didn’t realize how bad it actually was until I got out of the relata year later. Then again last year I was going out with a guy who was very very manipulative and really used me until I was nearly broken. During this time I tried to stay as supportive of her as I could even though she did do some hurtful things to me. Well we both are doing better now. I’m still struggling but it is better and we went out yesterday. She told me she like this guy called Dave. I’ve met dave before and he is troubble. He is mean and very egotistical. She said she knows this but she still wants to maby date him. I told her she deserves better then him and that there is a good guy out there somewhere. She said there is no good relationship and I deisgreed so she said what about your relationships. It hurt me a lot because the guys I was with were so mean and I really struggled for a long time because of it. Its not like I knew they were bad news at the start they were nice but once they got a hold of me they took advantage of me. Its not the first time she has used such things against me but I forgave her because she was in a bad place. She also called me desperate which is defenetly not the case.

I Think My Mom Is Going Crazy	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	3	"She asked me not to talk about this, but I think I have to, because I don’t know what else to do.

Everything started around a month ago, I had come back home from a night at my aunt’s house. My mom was excited and she immediately sat me down at the table, my sister was rolling her eyes and she looked annoyed about the entire thing. My mom had told me she’d had a spiritual awakening, and that she thought she had died. She said she felt spiritual, as thought she was an angel brought to help “wake people up”. I’ve never been overly religious, but I’m pretty open minded, so I said okay, asked her some questions and dropped it. 

Then, around two weeks after that night, she came home in a horrible mood. She screamed, and threw things, and stomped. It was horrifying but no one reacted. We left her alone and let her throw a tantrum and let it pass. I came downstairs to eat at around 12 AM, and she came down, and it was like she was in a trance. After breaking shit just a few hours earlier she was completely calm, sitting down at the table, watching a priest talk and humming. It genuinely gave me chills. 

Then, it all went to shit yesterday. I thought the spiritual stuff was over, she stopped talking about it and I stopped thinking about it. I woke up at around 3 PM, I went downstairs, greeted my mom and was about to start talking to her about some news that had happened the previous day. She sat me down, and told me she made a major breakthrough. She told me we were all zombies, that our brains were poisoning us, that oxygen is poisoning us, food, sleep. I knew that what she was saying was insane, but for some reason I didn’t feel she was insane. She said we were all zombies in a trance, that we needed to “awake”. It was all incredibly overwhelming, my head started pounding, I could hear every little sound and the world was spinning around me. She told me it was normal to get lightheaded when you were close to awakening. 

She told me she could tell I was close. That she could see it in my eyes, that I was close to awakening. She tried to break my aunt out of jail, she didn’t take a weapon, she just calmly told the guard my aunt got out today (she didnt), and the guard almost let her out. She posted a bunch of cryptic shit on facebook, trying to awaken our family. Things about needing to wake up, about gas not being real, about needing to start a revolution.

My sister got pretty angry when my mom talked about it. My mom told me she was close, that anger was part of it when you resisted waking up. She told me the night she had slammed things around, she was angry because she had been resisting. 

I heard my mom arguing with my sister. She was angry because she was “trying to save the world” and she told my sister that she was going to do everything to save the world for her kids.

She told me before now she had never been sure if she loved us. She told me that she had always never known if she was raising us to look good to other people or if she loved us, but that she knew now that she did love us.

I’ve been ignoring my friends, my girlfriend, everyone for the last 24 hours because of the amount of pure shock and confusion I’ve been in, and I just need to say something to anyone."	offmychest	2022-07-02T09:08:16.000Z	momthrowaway223
I think my boyfriend tearing me down.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	1	"I (25F) have a bf (23M) who i met through a mutual friend through PlayStation and we have been dating for about 8 months. He travels to my state he’s been here three times and it’s great i love having him around and enjoy his company. I have yet to visit his state though. 
    
Lately he’s been really disrespectful. His ""jokes"" are really offensive and tasteless. When I get offended he’s annoyed or angry and says I take too much to heart. I’ve been in three other relationships with heavy Domestic V and a few times gRapE lucky to be alive.I care about him so much that I’ve shared with him things that I’m struggling with. He’s actually really caring and supportive on so much. My issue is that recently he’s so mean. Agressive and just i don’t want to be around him cause it will end in us sitting on FaceTime giving each other the silent treatment lol. But we talk every single day so i know it’s not like cheating or anything but idk what this change in mood and behavior is. I’d rather he break up with me than to keep treating me like shit.

It’s just lately he’s been really bad with insulting me and trying to laugh it off. I’m starting to feel overly sensitive. I’ve tried talking to him about it but it’s just still happening. I don’t know what to do at this point and I’m just about to say eff everything and everybody.

I'm tired of these cringe youtube mobile gaming adverts.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"Why is it when I go to watch a video on Youtube I encounter such cringe? Bad acting, bad scripts, bad everything. The actors are terrible and the lines are cringe.

 I seen one today where two guys were at the front desk in a hotel room and both said at the exact same time ""I would like to upgrade to the presidential suite"". The cringy receptionist responds with ""We only have one presendentional suite left"". Yes, I spelled presendentional the way she said it above.

The two guys proceed to go at one another with how high of a level they are and the collection of characters they have. Then the receptionst starts acting turned on when she hears one guy has a certain character. 

Am I missing something here? Are they targeting a very specific audience with these adverts? I don't remember childrens adverts being so cringe, and I AM SICK OF THEM. Plus I'm not a kid anymore so I don't know how they're popping up, as my youtube history would not generally highlight that I have an interest in these.

Trying to have conversations with him is more frustrating &amp; pointless than talking to a wall &amp; expecting it to say something. The only shred of respect I have left for him is that he's always worked. Even that seems barely meaningful now.

He rarely remembers conversations or his actions. He is not a partner at all. He's a drunk man baby that causes chaos, stress, destruction.

Most people like him. I used to but now I'm indifferent. I've always said he's a good person with a drinking problem. I won't be saying that anymore. He's not a bad person but the absence of bad does not make one good. I've always worked on myself, my issues &amp; will until the day I die. He hasn't made any consistent progress. He makes a little effort for a short time only to passify me just long enough. Hard to progress when you're drunk everyday.

I know I'm gonna leave him permanently &amp; blocked and I feel nothing. How does one have yrs of therapy, DUI's, arrests &amp; still not deal with your issues? How is there so little self improvement over so many yrs? 

Watching a grown ass man drunkenly stumble, fall, slur his words &amp; have no self control at all nearly every night is so very unattractive. 

I feel almost sedated. Even if I should feel bad, guilty, sad for him, I just don't care. Idc if he or anyone else thinks I'm a bad person for all this."	offmychest	2022-07-02T08:40:32.000Z	HunyBuny64
I'm So Tired	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"I'm so tired of everything. I'm tired of my shitty job. I'm tired of constantly worrying. I'm tired of my endless self-loathing.

I just don't know what to do. I feel so defeated against everything. I already accepted long ago that I will never feel love and more recently realized I will likely never own my own place to live. Despite all this I don't want to kill myself, I just want to stop existing.

The worst part is that I don't even have any escapisms anymore. I don't enjoy anything anymore, just endless dread when it comes to everything I used to like.

And I hate going to the doctor just for them to do what feels like nothing but be skeptical of my problems everytime. And I don't want to be a spiteful person but sometimes I just can't help it, I'm so jealous of people who will never have to go through this I can't even understand what that would feel like. I'm not in to the whole pity party thing but everytime I'm up in the middle of the night in pain  I can't help but feel hate that can be pointed at no one.	offmychest	2022-07-02T08:32:00.000Z	itizwhatitizz_

I feel like an absolute piece of crap. I know it isn't my fault but I feel like somehow I should of been there to protect her. I'm trying to be there for her and be supportive but I don't know what to say or how to act. I'm writing this now because it's about 4am for me and I can't sleep because I can't get my mind to stop.

losing friends over stupid stuff	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"Me and this guy were friends since 2019, we met up and we are both in committed relationships but we were still friends. I got the vibe that she was always secretly jealous, I always got the feeling but over the years i figured it was really gone.  Sometimes, just sometimes, I felt she purposely tried to alienate our friendship and I feel like she succeeded due to a week point.  

I really hate her.  I never wanted to admit it because admitting it meant I put it out into the world.  

The guy I was friends with we had a few spats and his way of dealing with it was to ignore me, when I wanted to talk about the situation.  After all these years, we had something come up where I wasn't willing to submit.  I am a stubborn person and you have to prove to me that I've done wrong in some way before I agree to an apology.  Most times it's a miscommunication issue and if it's through text and both parties aren't clear, no one should apologize for something we SHOULD have done through text. 

So, I made the mistake of telling his wife((same person)) about some of the abuse I dealt with from my mother and parents.  It was bad shit, I was mentally in a bad way and it was nice to go to someone about it. She went and told him about it without my permission, I gently asked if she could keep it between us.  She agreed, only to go to him crying about how mad I was that she got caught.  This is the kicker: he told me he manipulated her, forced her to tell him because I felt this was a breech of my trust.  Instead of both of them admitting they were wrong, she avoided me and he refused to admit he wrong. 

He exchanged a lot of shitty words, I agreed to finally drop it without an apology.  He says we are all good but he avoids me for 3 months. I ask him about it today and he redirects to a conversation his wife and I had after I streamed.  She seemed to be accusing me of having an issue due to something I said on stream that had nothing to do with him, I waves it off and said it wasn't about it.  He brings it up and acts like I should have understood context. He said I was dismissing his feelings and her entirely when that wasn't the case but he refused to hear it.  Formally ending our friendship because he was alienated for a long time, uncomfortable with random things that he never told me about. 

Instead of telling me things, he chose to be end our friendship through text. I was his best friend for 4 years, I helped him move to 2 places, I helped him get a job as a reference but all of his issues he says were all my fault, I'm the problem, I'm the reason why people drop me because I always have to be right.  

Yet, in that conversation, I apologized multiple times, told me why I wad sorry, tried to mend thing and talk it out.  I'm super devastated by the loss of his friendship, it's also so damn awkward because I helped him get into our apartment complexes.  So, he lives literally one building over -- no avoiding it. 

I knew his wife facilitated this because I've seen how she manipulates.  She immediately blocked and removed me from everything, literally not even a goodbye, even tho I was able to keep calm while he told me he never wanted to see me again.

I've found out that I've lost friends over text shit, so no more will I accept text-based discussion about problems. I've lost 6 friends through text miscommunication.  I'm so damn depressed, so damn hurt and depressed."	offmychest	2022-07-02T07:49:20.000Z	hydraeans

Dreams make me sad because it won’t happen	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	5	Everyone dreams and they either have good ones or bad ones. I dream of wanting a bff that turns into my life long partner. We both are goofballs and weirdos. We are always there for one another and support each other. We have a lot of common interests and a very very similar personality. We are freakishly similar. We are both alternative oddballs. We go on dates in the cemetery. We play video games together. They help give me ideas for my next story because I’m a writer. They have the same kink/fetish as me. We live in a gothic Victorian home or castle or mansion. We have tons of acres of land and we have 3 dogs( border collie, husky and a German Shepard). We grow old together and never change our style or aesthetic. This is my dream and fantasy but I have no friends and never have dated anyone. I’m 20 and will be alone forever. Dreaming this dream each day just makes me sad because I wish it could happen. But wishes aren’t real and they don’t come true.	ForeverAlone	2022-07-02T07:21:36.000Z	throwaway67890216

A friend of a friend is interested in me, but I’m not really attracted to her back. Looking for opinions/advice	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	29	25	"I’m 23 and have never been in a relationship. A friend of mine tells me one day that her friend is into me, and then later gave her my number (without telling me she was going to, but whatever, that’s beside the point). So we’ve been texting and whatnot. We talk when we run into each other (we’re coworkers).

But yeah. She’s really into me and stuff, and I really wish I felt the same way. I’m so cripplingly lonely and touch-starved. I have always thought that I would do damn near anything for a relationship, but I’m just not feeling anything between us here the way that she is.

I also can’t help but feel like she has put me on such a high pedestal that the further she gets to know me, the more disappointed she’s going to be in me as a person.

Aside from the fact that I am not exactly attracted to her, I also don’t think I’m really in a place mentally where I should be trying to date anyone. My head is so all over the place that I’ve struggled to even type this out.. lol.

I got accused of secretly taking pictures of a guys wife at the gym	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	23	48	"It sounds fake lol but it's true. I've been going to the gym a little over the year and I'm kinda aspie and anxious, kinda hard for me to courage up daily to even go to the gym. I keep my head down and don't look at men or women on purpose because I know I'm worthless and so I don't come off as a weirdo. I don't feel like the gym helps but I keep going anyway.

So I guess the girl didn't confront me about me taking pictures of her, and she went home to tell her husband, and then brought him to the gym to talk to me about it. The girls husband comes to talk to me as I'm leaving the gym and asks if I secretly have been taking pictures of his wife.

It was so out of the blue I was kinda shocked and didn't know how to respond. I just said no a few times and offered to talk. We talked and I said I was innocent and I wouldn't do that, and I think he believed me because he was visibly shaken but seemed to calm down. I should have had a 3-way talk because I think she was also in the gym somewhere. I think the guy believes me but idk if the girl does.

I use my phone as a crutch so I just stare at my phone, and also have a workout sheet that I fill out with asterisks while doing a workout, and check the time on my phone, so I'm assuming she thought I was secretly taking pictures of her like a perv when I look at my phone for the time or double check my sets or put an asterisk in?

It's just... The #1 thing I try to do is not be a creep, and mind my own business, but I guess I look so much like a creep that anything that could seem like I am then everyone thinks I am.

It's the worst feeling in the world to be accused of being a perv when my whole goal is to just keep to myself because I know I'm ugly and awkward.

I'm already very depressed, suicidal, and feel like I have no worth and looked creepy. This confirmed I guess that I'm voted 'most likely to do creepy things' based on appearance.

The two things I'm gonna try to do is not cut myself and just try to cry if I can and move on... I may try to convince the woman on Tuesday when I go back to the gym for my normal routine.

I also thought if the security footage is good enough maybe that could prove my innocence?

Regardless it just really sucks, even if the woman also ends up believing me that I didn't do anything... Because it's like... That was my biggest fear is that 'people think I'm a creep' which came true even though I'm not."	ForeverAlone	2022-07-01T22:04:48.000Z	babskek

I try to post about the struggles anywhere else and I’m told to “work on myself” and that nothing is going to get better if I sit with the attitude of “woah is me” and feel sorry for myself. But that’s not really my issue, when I post it’s just to vent online because I can’t really do that IRL. You guys know that you can work really hard on yourself for years and still be in the same place in terms of your social life.

Nobody will understand. The sad truth is nobody really, really cares. People are selfish. Valuing only themselves and catering for the own needs. Berated by them for doing the things that they are doing. Looked down upon, seen as useless, worthless, stupid, ignorant, idiotic… and the list goes on.

Keep falling into the same trap	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	2	"So mentally up and down a lot. Have issues talking to people about it irl for a number of reasons. Because of my personal experience, I try to help people with their mental health problems (provide support etc.) but it just causes an extra thing to feel shit about when those people don’t provide similar (or any) support back.

So more specifically on this occasion, I recently reacquainted with some old friends (over the last 12-18months). Both have various MH problems. And whenever they are down, I’m always going out my way to help in whatever way I can. However, recently Iv been spiralling down myself again, and I’ve mentioned a few times that im not feeling great etc. and I don’t even get an acknowledgement from them, nevermind support. I try and arrange things for us to do to try and help/distract myself and they don’t even reply half the time. And then it just makes me feel worse.

This seems to happen with every group of friends i make. And just leaves me feeling increasingly isolated. Feel like I’m just a doormat for everyone else’s problems and no-one gives a fuck about how I actually feel when I need some help."	depression	2022-07-02T12:28:48.000Z	Expert_Imaginary
i want to die	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"Im a 29 yo girl and i've been depressed for years. It has escalated in recent years and i just dont see how my life can get better, i think i will never be happy (im sorry if it sounds dramatic).

Heres my story:
At the age of 21 I was generally happy. I started to think about my future and wanted to study and start a meaningful career. I love animals so i wanted to become a vet. 

My parents convinced me to study medicine instead and im a people pleaser so i agreed. Of course after 1 year of pre-med and 2 years of med school i broke and i left. I couldn't continue, it wasnt for me and this is when i started being depressed. 

I felt like a faliure. My parents were very disappointed (especially my dad) and they teased me about it. Immediately after i started to save money to study something else, and after 1 year i started studying computer science. 

And then Covid 19 came. I started failing at school again and after 2 years i got kicked out because of failing. This broke me. It has been a year since i stopped studying and i haven't been able to find a decent job.

 Im living with my parents, no degree, no skills, no savings (spent it all on school), no love life (i hate myself and im ashamed in my situation so i cant even think that someone would be interested in me, and even if someone shows interest im too ashamed to talk about where i am in life). 

I have only 2 friends left and they are a couple, and i mostly talk to them on discord. Im loneley and im a failure, i hate myself so much. I just dont think i can get out of this situation and i want to die.

 I am taking anti depression pills but they dont work.
I cant really talk about it with anyone without alarming them so i just wanted to vent here. 
Im crying while making this post. How did i end up like this? How did i fail 2 different degrees? How i cant find a job for a full year? How am i still living woth my parent? I just want this to end

Ps- im sorry for my broken english, it is not my native language and i am really upset when writing this"	depression	2022-07-02T09:44:32.000Z	cheeky_beef1
Looking for advice	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"I'm not really. Against the rules so feel free to remove the post please. Maybe I just want to vent. Don't respond it's okay there's not much

I don't know where to start, or what to say. It feels like everything is fake.

Am I even depressed really? I probably the ""best"" life so far. No traumatic incidents, stable and all that. Someone else would've made an amazing use of my life. I want something to fill this hole, I want this to stop, I don't want to keep living anymore I jst want to die. I don't see any hope for the future, everything is expensive, politics is fucking us over while the rich and the government fuck us over. Everything is fucked.

I try to be happy, some days things seem to be working, I try to get work done. I do it hoping I'll feel better, but no it only makes me feel even shitty. I try to listen to upbeat and fun songs, even have a playlist but I just get fucking annoyed, and when I don't, it feels fake, and as I am seemingly enjoing the beat, out of nowhere there's this ""snap back to reality"" moment and I can't anymore, and start feelign liek absolute shit and think ""enjoying huh, what a fucking faker I am, pathetic, faking happiness you piece of shit how narcistic can you be you low life (low death?)"" or something along those lines. And go to this playlist of sad slow depressive songs in hopes that it'll help me vent but no. I feel numb tired, cna't even pay attention to the whole fucking song, keep skipping halfway through. What am I lookng for? The only songs so far that kinda break the numbness and let me at the least get moist eyes are from some pretty emotional anime, and when I feel really restless cant sleep, I put on these songs and then cut and even then I can only half vent cutting doesn't feel cathartic anymore why why did that one last thing that helped me not work anymore. I remember trying to vent and thinking ""why the fuck isnt it working its supposed to work come on""

I feel like I'm on this up-down ride. I feel like I'm making progress by staying clean, working towards small goals and achieving them, be it as small as wake up and fucking brush my teeth. But then the payoff isn't there. I don't feel happy. I feel normal, the depressive thoughts aren't as intense, and I try to go about my life but then I can feel going down the slippery slope into a despair. I feel like I'm always looking over my shoulder for that day to arrive, and when it does I feel like absolute shit. I sleep deprive myself sleep for about 6 hours but at random times so that I don't think too hard but with work I have to wake up and sleep on time and this clarity is fucking me over I want to bash my head into the wall sometimes. I see a highway across my building and want to jump off and get run over and die in the most goresome way possible

I try to distract myself with games, music, anime, TV shows, try to go out but nothing works, I'm not enjoying them *at all*. I forced myself to socialize with friends a few ttimes, and while the moment of pool recently felt good, I felt like I was wasting their time, and felt like a piece of trash for even planning to go meet. I just want to cut them all off, and disappear into the woods and die. I can't focus on work, cant focus on college can't focus when reading a goddamn assignment and has impacted my grades. The other day I was feeling a bit sleepy at work and had a coffee after so many months (I try to take coffee only when I need it) but that only made me restless faster, was still feeling sleepy and the restlessness became worse.

Anything I try to do makes me feel like shit. I try to enjoy food, the last thing I genuinely seem to enjoy even when I'm in the depths of shit but feels like it's losing taste. I'm having to force myself to sit through anything. I just can't anymore. I want to give up and kill myself but the only thing holding me back are the faces of my parents sad. Why the fuck is it so hard to wake the fuck up. I am tired. Why doesn't my body give up despite years of abuse. cmon take me already, that heart attack, that seizure that coma pls take me I don't want to keep living anymore. I want to abandon my search for a reason to live. I want to at the least be able to payback my parents for all they've done and struggled for me but fucking hell how the hell can I ever repay them damn. I wish they could forget about me and disown me for the failure I am and just ask me to fuck off and die.

Everywhere I go all I can think about is death, and ways to die. Trucks running me over, jumping off buildings, getting shot, jumping off buildings, brain eating amoeba in lakes, cancer, diseases electrocution cutting and blood poisoning overdose suffocation starvation food poisoning appendicitis. I don't use a seatbelt in carpool commute (don't worry I'm a rider, NOT a driver, as piece of shit as I am, I'd rather not cause anyone else harm) hoping someone crashes into me and takes me out. I wish I could just blow my brains out or someone trigger happy shoots me in the fucking head please. I'm fucking pathetic never even attempted suicide but keep talking about it isnt tha just looking for attention. Fucking hell what a scumbag I am acting depressed, acting like I'm going to suicide even when I am not fucking pathetic cowardly sucm

I had this dream one day, that I died, and when I woke up, I had this flood of peace take me over, and was really jarring to realize I was alive and broke down so hard just cried the whole fucking day. I wish I could ""donate"" my life to someone not as fortunate as me (for example a poster here had family issues), me take their place, and then die off. Fuck man I have so much right in my life yet use so little, waste everything, fucking scum on this planet. I feel even unworthy to be depressed fucking hell what am I even depressed for goddamnit I mean I'm just a whining adult, shame on me right can't even adult properly. I want to die so hard, but I cant. Please, just someone put me out of my misery. Someone on my campus died in an accident that should've fuckig been me why that person should've been me fuck"	depression	2022-07-02T08:23:28.000Z	dexter2011412

Social Media	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"Lately have been spending too much time on my phone just scrolling and scrolling and scrolling for hours and hours and hours... Ugh! By the end of the day I have an unbearable headache that I lose control of my emotions and have full blown panic attacks. 

I'm so sick of it. I can't even brush my fucking teeth without wanting to stand there and scroll through some app! 

I feel like constantly listening to something in the background (videos, podcast) is a way for me to cope with a lingering issue that i have with being alone and bored. I spent a year and a half in Alaska (military)
without family or friends and I sometimes think I have some kind of PTSD where I will panic if my surroundings go silent. Sometimes I struggle with talking. I hate talking. I'm so used to not talking or interacting with anyone. I rather sit on my phone then have a conversation with someone sitting next to me.
also feel like my brain constantly has to be stimulated. 

I finally deleted my social media today and I'm hoping to stay away for at least a week. I think I'm going to pick up crocheting again and try to read some more. The only thing I didn't delete was Reddit but that's because I'm barely on it. I only look and read the fucked up shit on here. Anyway, that's why I'm sharing this now."	depression	2022-07-02T06:11:12.000Z	tgtukrtgm
feeling ashamed of being depressed	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	hi, i’m schizoaffective bipolar type and i’m currently having one of the most intense depressive episodes i’ve had in awhile. despite the fact that depression is symptom that i face that is most common and accepted by society id say, it’s by far the one i feel the most shame about. i feel pathetic and disgusting for feeling this way. even though both my parents have depression it’s so hard for me to talk about this with them. even with my girlfriend whom suffers from extremely severe depression i feel embarrassed to talk about this with. how do i get over this ?	depression	2022-07-02T11:54:40.000Z	Old-Coconut8574
fuck.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"people often say “it feels like my life is falling apart” but right now it’s a reality for me. (i really just need to vent/type out my thoughts). 

so i’ll start with the stupid suspicion that my now ex-best friend was sleeping with my ex-girlfriend. a couple days ago after not responding for a my ex finally texts me back and not only shuts down my suspicions but expresses her own… about literally half of the people in my closest group of friends texting her, etc. because of my thoughts from the beginning i pushed my best friend away and now we barley talk. we were so close a few people thought we were gay in highschool 😂. 

this was the first time i had spoken to my ex in a while and i found out she works with a girl i was getting really close with and liked a lot. i didn’t want her to find out some other way so i just told her and she told me she already knew. the next day both of them completely ghosted me with no explanation. we had this really romantic date planned for the fourth too. it was one of the few thing i had to look forward to.

chapter 2: the injury. so last weekend i was so hyped for this skateboarding competition that i sped home from work and hoped for days i could make it on time for the intermediate section but nope. but after a lot of convincing from the skatepark homies i found myself competing in the advanced group. i did ok up until the end where on a flat ground trick the board landed weird with my front foot pinning done the front of my board which left a deep gash on the inside of my knee. i covered the cut but something was wrong with my knee. it would pop and give me very intense pain anytime i moved it wrong. after my second doctors visit they told me nothing looked wrong. fast forward to now and i have been out of work for a week and cooped up inside beyond bored. but i’m constantly doubting if there’s anything wrong with me and if i’m just being soft. my dad keeps making these extremely unsubtle jokes hinting at his suspicion of the same thing. i literally know my knee isn’t ok but i can’t accept it. i’m literally losing my mind over this.

chapter 3: death. i’ve never been the type to be really affected by the news but damn dude… everyday there’s a new mass shooting or something horrible. this isn’t the point of me bringing this up though. last weekend my childhood best friend was just murdered. his funeral was today. kinda glad it was a closed casket because i was like an inch away from passing out as it was. this part really hurts but i’m just gonna leave it at that.

chaper 4: 1000 little things. i haven’t been to the gym in idek how long, my therapist has been out for a what feels like forever, and my dad crashed into my car.

the worst part though is that i’m afraid. i feel like i’ve been protected by my injury. my leg is starting to feel better and soon i’m gonna have to face the world again. maybe it’ll be good for me. i hope. i’m lost but i’m too afraid to find myself because then i have to hold myself accountable. no more excuses. i hate this injury but it feels like i need it. it’s protecting me from facing my problems."	depression	2022-07-02T03:44:00.000Z	AtmosphereDizzy3643
I’m repulsed by showers to the point of paralysis	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"I have a giant mental block surrounding hygiene, to the point where I regularly go several days without taking care of myself. The thought of taking a shower, brushing my teeth, washing my face, and washing my hair repulses me. I’m in my grandmother’s house and it’s not the cleanest. I think about the germs in the sink and the shower. I think about the dirt on the floor. There’s rust on the walls and ceiling, and black residue in between the crevices of the tub. The only solution I have found is to wear shower shoes, shower and brush my teeth with the lights off. Even then, thinking about touching my body or the surfaces in the bathroom make me nauseated. I sit on the couch all day and don’t move because I’m too dirty to go anywhere, but I can’t drag myself to the bathroom without feeling like I’m going to cry.

I was living in my own apartment for a few months, but I couldn’t take care of myself. The thought of cleaning would disgust me, and I could only clean the bathroom once. I wouldn’t wash my hair until I left for my grandmother’s, I wouldn’t brush my teeth and shower for days at a time. 

I was raised by a hoarder, and we lived in squalor. The bathroom was never clean, the toilet would be grimey and broken. The tub would be gross, and the sink and floor would be cluttered. There was dirt packed in between the crevices and mice would run in the doorway. The condition of the hoard threw me into daily panic attacks, meltdowns, and tic fits, as my brain literally could not process information looking at the extreme mess. The gaslighting from the hoarder, and living in those conditions threw me into psychosis. I believe she is a narcissist.

I know I need professional help, but I don’t know what kind of therapist I should seek. I’m falling apart, and I don’t move all day. I want to start getting ready so I can start being productive."	depression	2022-07-02T03:24:48.000Z	jetson0

My mom hugged me, crying, begging me not to die	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	10	F22. The relationship between my mom and I has been quite bad but today she hugged me for the first time in like 10 years because I honestly told her how awful I’m doing. I’ve been feeling worse then normal. I feel defeated. I got a really bad burnout when I was 19 and I still haven’t recovered. I had to quit college and my job. It ruined friendships and ruined my life. I was FINALLY making progress the past 3 months. I was able to walk 15 minutes every night. At first I could barely walk 1 minute. But on the 19th of June, my birthday for fucks sake, I caught corona for the first time. And it has made me so exhausted that I get out of breath and have to sit down while taking a shower. I’ve been freaking exhausted for like 2,5 years and now it’s way worse than before. I don’t know for how much longer I can hold on and keep fighting. I want to disappear. I gained a lot of weight in those 2,5 years and I’m terrified of gaining more. I hate myself and the decisions I made which led to my burnout. My mind tortures me with horrible memories every damn day. And it hurts to see how badly I affect everyone around me. I broke down today after a night of insomnia. Not being able to sleep at all. I told my mom everything I was holding back. And it made her cry. She begged me not to give up. Not to die. And now I feel embarrassed and shitty about telling the truth. It hurts me when I hurt someone else because of my mental health issues. I want to die but I also don’t want to die. I’m terrified of death. But I don’t know how many months I can still deal with this exhaustion and depression. I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m on the verge of losing hope. I feel like I might never recover. And what if I will recover but it will take away years of my life? Will it really be worth all the suffering or will I eventually end up with another burnout? Or maybe something worse? I’ve tried everything I could think of. Therapy, medication, chronic fatigued clinic, walks, vitamin pills, sleep doctor, weighted blanket, etc. But so far most things somehow made my situation worse. I’m just too weak to live in this world. I wish I never existed.	depression	2022-07-02T10:50:40.000Z	Fluffy-Weapon

my ex wife	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	0	"scared my ex wife might hurt herself and i cant do anything, i would have to tell our kids and i would be broken but she wont get help because thats weakness.. 

I was getting my life together and now i am back to this feeling of helplessness again.

She says she is severly depressed and needs prayer, i asked whats wrong and she said she wanted to do stupid things. I kept talking about good things in her life and she says she ruined everything like always. She was going to go out and leave her phone so she couldnt call anyone, usually means drinking. She is at school and i reminded her that she was pursing her education to get a job and house then the kids would live with her. I cant stop caring becasue the kids and i have a personality that makes me want to take care of people but i know i cant and am scared that this fear is going to be reality. How do i move on and how do i do that with the kids who are not even 11 yet. I cant sleep and relax now and i am on day one of my 17 day no work vacation. What the crap this hurts. I tried getting her to promise she would get help if she decided hiding behind the mask was not enough anymore and she wouldnt do it. I told her she shoild talk to someone and she wouldnt do it. Here i am in the middle. Do people not inderstand what they do to others when they start down this path, that they are cared for and have people here for them. My brother killed himself and i will never no why and now this person also who i loved and will always care for wants to leave us all here. I was afraid that wehn i turned thirty that i too would want to die because my brother did so i loved with that fear until i was 31.

How are you supposed to get better if you don’t have anybody?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	1	"I don’t have any kind of support system. At all. I see 3 friends at most once or twice a month, and that’s if I’m incredibly lucky. My parents are not the right people for help. My friends and I don’t talk about mental health and I don’t exactly feel comfortable sharing to them. I have a therapist, but I don’t feel like we’ve connected and I don’t feel like she understands. I have nobody else in my life. 

I have nobody I can talk to about my day. I have nobody I can do things with. I have nobody to ask for help. I have nobody that cares about me in any meaningful way. I have nobody, and I never have. I’ve never had anything more than this. I’ve always been doing everything on my own, and I’m fucking tired. I’m tired of doing this all by myself.

I hate myself more than anything. I told myself I’d apply to my old job soon, but I’m getting too scared about showing up in public. I’ve been getting nightmares about going, that’s how much I’m dreading it. I hate how I look, I hate how I act, I hate everything there is to hate about myself and nobody, nobody is there to help me prove it wrong. Nobody assures me that I’m not doing things wrong. As far as I know, I’m fucking everything up.

I want to quit everything I’ve ever done. I want to drop out of college even though I’m almost finished, I want to hide in a room for the rest of my life and starve. I don’t want to do this. I can’t do this alone. I’ve been like this for my whole life and now I’ve reached the point where I can’t interact with people anymore. I would give up every single “accomplishment” in my life to have the chance to not be alone in a fucking heartbeat. Anything I’ve ever done, I’d give it all up, and I wouldn’t care fucking one bit that it was gone. It’s meaningless. It’s fucking meaningless doing this to impress nobody but yourself, and “yourself” is just embarrassingly horrible.

I can’t do this alone. But there is absolutely zero chance of me being able to interact with anyone where I’m at right now. No matter how hard I try, I can’t convince myself that I’m not wholly fucking terrible, because everything everything everything I do doesn’t work. Everything I try makes me feel worse. I’m getting physically unhealthy because of the toll my mental health is taking on me. I’m losing hair, I’m losing sleep, I’m getting headaches, my blood pressure is high, I’m losing weight, I feel like shit all the time, for years and years and years.

I barely take care of myself anymore. I know I probably look shitty, and I know that’s not helping. But I can’t do it. I can’t even feed myself most days, how am I supposed to pick myself up? I force myself to do things that are good for me and they make it worse. I haven’t found ANYTHING that works. Nothing makes me happy, nothing takes any of the pain off of me, nothing at all. Hobbies. Exercise. Therapy. Nothing. It doesn’t do anything. I’m tired of people telling me I’m not trying hard enough. I AM trying so fucking hard, but it’s me, it’s this fucking mental block that prevents any progress from being made. I’m sick of it. I’m so fucking angry. I’m never going to get past it.

There’s nothing out there for me. There’s nobody out there for me. I fucked up, I fucked everything up, and there’s just nothing I can do anymore. I’ve heard the excuse I’m young, sure, fucking fine. But what is there I can do that works? I can’t unlearn a lifetime of pain. I’ve lost my ability to function normally. I’ll never get it back. It’s just too late. I had my chance, and I blew it.

My life was over the moment I was born. I feel like I was doomed for failure. I don’t see the point in trying, because everything hurts me so fucking bad."	depression	2022-07-02T09:08:16.000Z	benianse
I have been struggling with Depression for a while, and it's starting to effect my social life.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	"Hey everyone, I haven't been able to talk to anyone about this for a while so this is kind of my last resort to get help. I've been feeling very depressed for about six months and it's getting progressively worse, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder back in 2020 and was put on medication to help with it, although I stopped taking it a long time ago. 

I've been kicked out of 4 or 5 places (where I lived) all in this one year, and now I'm flatting with two people. I turned 17 in April this year so I'm not even legally old enough to be flatting, but I've got no other choice because my mom moved far down south (5 hour drive from where I am now, really long distance when you're 17 and don't have any money or a car). All of this stress has really gotten to me lately and my friends are telling me that I've changed, some of them say that I'm more cruel now and more judgmental. I usually act on impulse so it makes sense that I would come off as cruel when it feels like the world is being cruel to me.   


I don't want paint myself as a victim, but god damn it's hard not to feel like a victim when it feels like the world hates you. I've been smoking a lot of pot lately, I thought that it would help me escape but it never does. Whenever I smoke pot I still feel depressed the only difference is I'm stoned and depressed. Suicide is definitely on my mind right now, I'm contemplating suicide but I don't have the balls to end it because it's completely irreversible and I don't like the idea of that. 

The reason why I came to this subreddit is to just talk about my issues, I've tried talking to friends and family about this but everyone seems so indifferent, or I freak them out and they don't want to hear from me anymore. People keep telling me it'll get better soon but what does that actually mean? like I've moved away from my abusive father but that doesn't get rid of the trauma he inflicted on me, I can keep persevering but how long will it take for me to start feeling happy again? One of my closest friends killed himself last year and that has been haunting me so much, people keep telling me why he killed himself, my dad would always tell me that he was weak and that depression is a week mentality. I hate him so much. He abused me, put me down when I was at my lowest, and made me feel worthless. When he wasn't putting me down or degrading me he would be telling me to get a job, which really put a lot of unnecessary stress on me.    


Sorry for the poor organization of the paragraphs, I'm really scatterbrained right now so I'm probably not very coherent. Hopefully it's readable enough that someone can understand it."	depression	2022-07-02T09:04:00.000Z	Pokechu2876

unhealthy emotional attachment to fictional characters	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	2	"hello. i’m not sure what the point of this post is i’m just seeking out people with a similar experience i think. i don’t remember have anyone to talk to about this in depth. my friends are pretty absent, especially during summer. i don’t feel comfortable talking to my family about this. this post, oddly enough, contains spoilers for volume two/season four of stranger things. 

i have somewhat diagnosed adhd (weird story, i love mental healthcare) and i get obsessive interests for various periods of time. i started stranger things after seeing some stuff about eddie munson’s character. i’m only on season 3, but i got the spoiler that eddie dies and i’m really fucking torn up about it. that sounds really dumb, but i don’t think it’s normal to have the kind of reaction im having to this- the death of a character i haven’t even seen properly. finding out is genuinely making me feel so hopeless. like so nauseous i can’t eat. maybe it’s just the topping on a pile of things wrong and that’s why it’s hitting so hard, but i feel so much genuine grief and sadness.

i feel gross. i don’t even know what to do with myself. my life is so boring. all i’ve done all summer is work, my friendships have become so stunted the only time i did manage to hang out with someone it was so awkward. i just feel like im rotting away at home. i use media to cope and had been using stranger things as my big source of happiness- it’s like the only thing really making me happy has been ripped from me and im just. fucking awful.

does anyone have any advice or similar experience? i would really appreciate hearing about it. thank you for reading."	depression	2022-07-02T08:46:56.000Z	lowlevelconsumer
So tired	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	After spending 2 years (I'm fine now) in an extemely high anxiety state due to some idiotic story I made up in my head I feel so exhausted physically. I feel it in my arms and upper body, my arms hurt and it feels like lines dragging me down. I can suck it up and do things but the problem comes when I want to read/study do something where I kinda need to relax, then I feel way too tired and can't do it. I started exercising, it hasn't helped. I sleep enough, go to bed at 10pm. I'm on abilify and prozac, abilify has made it worse so I will ask my psychiatrist to take me off of it, prozac hasn't done absolutely anything. What to do, am I doomed to live like this the rest of my life? I did a blood test, my thyroid hormones,cortisol etc are fine, everything is fine besides testosterone which is a bit high for a woman. I don't have PCOS. I'm overweight but losing weight. I don't think it's due to that because the exhaustion is so deep inside, the way I felt for those 2 years like I just want to give up but can't.	depression	2022-07-02T08:42:40.000Z	Infinite-Gene-9650

I’m probably not truly depressed but it’s been a tough week could really use some support	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	3	"I’ve been working nonstop for over a week like 16+ hours a day due to some big project deadline earlier this week and the rest of the week being busy while having to catch up. I’ve been physically and mentally worn out and very sleep deprived so some things got to me.

A while ago someone I considered a very good friend abruptly ended contact. I’ve mostly gotten over it but after I spoke about it with my therapist this week I felt way worse about the situation than I have been. I feel like my therapist failed to see the complexity of the situation and offered advice that was overly simplified. Even though she said I wasn’t at fault, she basically implied I should understand and accept his behavior because he’s been diagnosed with clinical depression. I don’t think depressed people should get a free pass at treating others poorly. I can understand if he doesn’t get back to me while going through a phase, but he never addressed it afterwards.

I started chatting with random redditors (on one of the make friends subs) out of boredom during one of my long work days and got mentally exhausted when people treated me like a lonely piece of meat. One guy sent me unsolicited shirtless pics while another guy read too much into it and started sending small talk messages to me multiple times a day. I don’t really have time for that and got overwhelmed, and suddenly I wondered if this is how I made my friend feel when he stopped talking to me. I felt horrible because I really cared about him. He understood me and never went beyond my boundaries. I felt horrible that I might have misunderstood him and crossed his boundaries, while at the same time I felt like he used me then discarded me.

In the midst of this exhaustion leading up to this downward mindset some other stuff happened at work that resulted in me having to take on extra responsibilities at the last minute.

Then I found out someone thinks I’m only of average attractiveness, when I’ve been working hard to improve my general self by hitting the gym and trying to dress better. I feel like I’m more attractive than they said I am and that feels discouraging.

All my close friends right now are going through some life shit. Before this week I was supporting them, and now I’m exhausted. They don’t know I’m going through this shit right now because they’re sorta gone at the moment dealing with their own stuff and my week deteriorated so quickly I haven’t talked with anyone.

I’m so tired right now, could use some support and encouragement from this sub."	depression	2022-07-02T07:10:56.000Z	saltedlime215

i failed math this year (so 5/6 classes) and had to attend summer school.
i passed summer school and i’m proud of myself. my dad was saying he was proud too but when he got mad at me he started saying that i “shouldn’t have even went there in the first place”. i can never be a regular teenager. i’m limited in my phone and get it taken at night. i don’t have netflix and can’t watch what i want. i don’t even think i deserve it.. the pain is just too much. idk why this numb feeling just won’t go away. i don’t know why i’m crying. i don’t know why i’m truly sad. i just feel so numb. i never had time to be a kid a lot either but i prefer to not be born at all. i wish i wasn’t born. i wish my parents didn’t decide to do “it” on whatever day they did it on. and i wish i was just enough. i feel as though i’ll never be enough for anybody. i hate myself. i don’t think i deserve enough love. maybe i’m just being dramatic idk. i hate my skin color. i have a caramel-light shade but it’s uneven due to sun exposure and it’s making me insecure. i hate my eyes. i hate my hair. i hate myself. i’m not even ready and not getting it together for highschool. no wonder no boys would want me like what. who would want me. there’s nothing good about me. i hate every single detail about myself and i hate my personality my voice and my laugh. i hate my face too. everytime i see it i just wanna cry. why couldn’t another one be chosen? why is it me? why did it have to be me? and idc if life “will get better” that’s not what i fuckinf wanted. i didn’t wanna be born or here. why can i just have a choice and leave? i don’t wanna hurt my mom though because i know even in her hardest days she stayed for me. i’m such a idiot. i’m a horrible daughter and sister and friend. everybody’s deserves better.

I have suffered	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	1	I have been trough hell. Unimaginable pain. Whatever trauma there is..I have seen and or experienced. Whatever pain you have felt, I have felt it. I have been tortured for 20 years. I have been through hells where agony was an escape from the true horrors that took place there. Few can say they have suffered quite like I have. From being chained to a hospital bed, unable to move, while my body was dying and my mind slowly descended into madness, to getting my heart shattered into a million pieces, to having my jaw break and my body slowly die all while having to deal with depression, ptsd, anxiety, ocd, dissociation, body dysmorphia, disordered eating and so much more, all of this in a matter of 5 months. I have suffered. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I have been trying to keep sane throughout all of this but I have failed. I have fully descended into madness.

My life isn't going anywhere, and I'm worried.	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	 To start, I suffer with major social anxiety. I've had major depression in the past. I am autistic. I have never had a job and I am 21 years old. My anxieties stop me doing pretty much anything that I SHOULD be doing. I still live at home with my ageing parents. I have no license. I find dating difficult and have never been in a serious relationship. I simply just don't see my life ever moving forward? I don't know where to start, or what to do. The more I stay shut away, the harder it gets yet I just don't know what to do to change it? When I try anything, I get shut down. When I get a push to apply for a job, if I get a call for an interview, I panic and can't bring myself to do it. I am too nervous to date after some bad experiences. I don't think I'll ever have the money to ever move out or do my own thing. Don't want this to come across as 'woe is me' I know many people have it so much harder. I'm lucky to have a roof over my head, and to have family who care, but I simply wont have this forever. I have literally done the same thing every day for 8 years since leaving school. I feel like I will never get a job, never have a family or do anything else. I am a failure to launch and it sucks. I Just see an endless void in my future.

Chinese Water Torture - Anger	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	3	"I'm new here, and just today I've come to realize I may have an anger problem.

I feel that all angers problems are different. I would like to explain how my anger feels like with an analogy. I also would like to know if any of you feel somewhat the same way. 

I found that the best way to explain how and why I get angry is with the analogy of Chinese Water Torture. More specifically, I want to use [this episode of MythBusters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFslAjUyj4&amp;t=474s&amp;ab_channel=ScootleRoyale) where they test this.

In the video, at 5:24, things go from physically ok to emotionally totally NOT ok.

To the observer, this seems abnormal.

First of all, Kari knows for sure that everyone in that room is someone she'd trust with her life. She knows this is an experiment. There are paramedics, camera crew, and people she already knows - she's not actually being tortured, she knows that. The moment she asks to be freed she will be freed. Not only that, but the torture uses random drops of water. She's not being hit with anything. She's not being twisted; she's not being burned. It's small drops of room-temperature water.

Yet, Kari loses it (5:54) in a moment of ""sheer terror and panic"". If you can empathize with her at all, you'll likely feel how fucking terrifying it is. 

To someone like you and me who deal with irrational levels of anger, it may be immediately obvious why. She says it herself: it's the ""restrains""! (6:17).

""I knew I could get up at any time"" also hits me hard. Very few of my anger bouts have been logical to me. Why am I choosing the silent treatment with people around me when I know I can just talk things through? Why am I fantasizing about beating the hell out of one of my idiot good-for-nothing (I mean that in and out of anger) coworkers if I know I can just talk to them and even let it go? Why am I so angry at the drive through - why on earth should I expect good service from underpaid-overworked employees serving 1000+ people? None of it makes sense! What is going on?!

I have a theory about Kari. During the exercise, even in the moment of sheer panic, there was one thing she chose to do (5:57). After her loving teammate commands to let her out free, she stops him and asks to be given a second. You know why I think she did this? To regain fucking control.

I may be wrong, but it still serves to explain how I feel. I don't WANT to act rational. That's the last thing I want to do. I want to regain control. I want it back. Life is always taking it away from me, restraining me, making me meet its stupid-ass demands (5:25). Dude, I don't even want FULL control, just control over what matters to me. But no. Not only that, but life then proceeds to spit on me at unpredictable intervals. It's frustration to no end. I want to call the shots for once. I want to tell everyone else they are the ones that need to meet due process instead of me. So, no, don't get me out of the torture bed just yet. I want to be mad.

But out of all this, the most damning thing about Chinese Water Torture is how it makes it difficult for other people to empathize with you. ""Oh, you were tortured with drops of water? Have you ever heard of bamboo torture? What about that guy who was boiled alive? Cry me a river!"" I mean, look at Adam (8:10), he seems to be doing totally ok! 

All of my life, I've only been ridiculed for being angry. This makes me never want to show my anger because people have a tendency of making fun of people who get angry. This is what hurts me the most. From their point of view, nothing actually torturous is happening to me. They just see water drops and a bed. Yet, they also witness how my feelings explode and I fall apart (5:43). To them, the only possible explanation is that I am a weak person not worthy of respect.

This is one of my favorite MythBusters episode. It makes me feel so validated! I love Kari for trying it. But, you get my point? Anger, for me, has always come from an accumulation of emotions, the violent end-result from small drops of water and restraint while people around me are not understanding me.

Like you, I hope to get better. No one's getting me out of this bed for the time being. So, I need to be like Kari and be strong AF. 

That's what it feels like anyway!"	Anger	2022-07-02T06:15:28.000Z	hiding_temporarily
It's always a choice between anger and logic	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	10	"I am a kind of person who gets angry over very small issues like doors not opening, earphone wires getting tangled etc. It's also because I am very impatient. To curb my anger, my strategy was always to practice patience until it becomes my character.

In the starting days, it was difficult to control my anger. It was like that Kevin Bacon character in X-Men first class movie trying to contain the blast of a grenade. But over time it became bearable. When something doesn't work my way, instead of applying sheer force, I tried using my brain to understand the reason why that particular thing is not working my way. Most of the time, this few seconds of thought process saves five minutes of stupid anger. I also get a feeling that I am becoming smart."	Anger	2022-07-02T01:50:56.000Z	ratusratus

I really hate PC gaming…	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	29	0	"So I had an Xbox Series S and loved playing Elder Scrolls Online, but I sold it so I could afford Christmas gifts this past Christmas. And I’ve been miserable ever since. I keep trying to make gaming on PC work for me, but it just stresses me out more than anything. Windows kept randomly crashing on my laptop even after several reinstalls (tried 10 and 11). In between crashes, I would try to play ESO, and while the framerate was fairly low, it was good enough for me. HOWEVER, I got really annoying graphical bugs such as shadows not rendering properly, and in most places water was just completely invisible. After some googling, I found out that it’s just a known issue with Intel integrated graphics that hadn’t been fixed. So it seemed like my two choices were to either live with the really ugly visual bugs or just not play the game. Neither of which satisfied me.

But then I remembered something. Back around when ESO first came out or shortly after, my brother had it on Mac. Specifically our old iMac. With Intel integrated graphics. So I thought “okay, maybe the Intel issue is only a thing on Windows.” So what was my solution? To hackintosh (install Mac OSX) on my laptop! So I went down that frustrating rabbit hole, finally got it installed and mostly working, and it’s somehow way more stable than Windows ever was on this laptop. Idk why or how, but okay.

So I then installed Steam and started downloading ESO. It took forever to download, but eventually finished. Then Steam needed to verify the files, and of course with my luck, some of them were corrupt, so Steam had to download them again and re-verify, which took another good long while. But eventually it was completely downloaded and verified. I launched it, and it opened the installer, which then told me that the game needed an extra 20GB that I didn’t have! So now here I am downloading the game in its entirety once again, this time onto an external HDD, which is making it take even longer due to the slower write speeds, and part of me wants to just give up now before I’ve even been able to actually launch the game.

I miss gaming on a console where everything is simple and just works, and when you download a game, it’s the game itself that gets downloaded and not an installer. And where everyone on the same platform has the same hardware, so you just don’t have to think about the hardware at all."	gaming	2022-07-02T11:24:48.000Z	SuzySuitcase

I love Marvel and have watched everything, but Ms. Marvel as a show and especially the most recent episode #4 is the worst media the MCU has released	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	14	0	"I liked the Eternals a lot, I thought Thor Dark World was ok and I've rewatched it for the important piece it plays in the canon, I watched Iron Fist and thought it had redeeming qualities and got better as the show went on, Inhumans was pretty bad but Anson Mount and Iwan Rheon were incredible in their respective roles and kept the show from being a complete liability, but Ms. Marvel is wholly dreadful. 

Without getting into specifics to avoid spoilers for the show or the most recent episode, everything is off-- the acting, the writing, the directing, the pacing, the tone, internal consistency-- the show does not make any narrative sense. It's genuinely difficult to suspend my disbelief for this show with how contrived everything feels. My wife and I spend the time we watch the show commenting on how laughably bad it is. And then I see episode 4 with a 9/10 rating on IGN, 100% for the series on rotten tomatoes? Are you kidding me? Episode 4 felt like a bad fever dream. It was all over the place. I've read reviews of shows feeling rushed in parts where they should go dwell and languishing in pointless moments, but have never fully agreed until now. 

With the show having such drastic discordance between reviews and reality, I have to stop and wonder what the heck is going on. Am I missing something? Does anyone else feel like this? This is the first time in the MCU where I thought the reviews could be rigged. And then I see posts with fans gushing about the show.

But then there's one person that joins often that just ruins the mood everytime. He's on the younger side and is always trying to be edgy, talking over people, and is always swearing. Now I'm one of the few who get along with them, I've had deep private conversations with them and theyre fine, but in group settings it just gets too much especially.

The worst thing is when I've been told people are avoiding hanging out in the server because of him.
I've had a similar problem in the past happen and people would just start having private DM calls but eventually it gets caught on cause they'll see us online in Valorant or whatever and it just causes drama.

When I minimize twitch and then come back into it, the stream turns black and I can only hear what is happening. I have tried changing the resolution of the stream and that doesn't fix anything.

2 - I used to watch streams and when I did Minimize twitch to say, play a game or something, I would be able to have a small version in the corner so I can play my game and watch a stream at the same time. When I try to back out of twitch now, it doesn't automatically set me to a small screen-in-screen anymore. How do I re-enable that?

am I wrong for disagreeing with backseat gaming?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	11	0	Hi I agree to do a stream of DMCV for a friend It's his favorite game, but he keep backseat gaming.

He keeps telling me do this or that thing, or how I messed up, and I find it all annoying and ruins the fun figuring out how the games works, and what to do and not to do. Instead of being told every feature and mechanic. He says he sees nothing wrong with be told everything the game has to offer, and I have a problem with being told what to do, and I to do it.

Stream issues but only when I watch 2 specific channels	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	3	1	" So,  I have been having this problem for a few months and it's infuriating  me. I only get buffering on two specific channels that stream in 720p,  all other channels I can watch on low latency in 720p or higher no  problem whatsoever with a minimal latency of a couple of seconds.  However, on these two specific channel I have to have a buffer of at  least 10 seconds with low latency turned off to watch without any  buffering and I hate trying to interact with streamers on a delay.

I  am in the UK and these two streamers are in Canada, one is partnered  one is affiliate if that makes any type of difference. It's not a  distance thing because I can watch other streamers all over without  issue, again in the same quality or higher.

I have tried different browsers, same issue

I have started the browsers up in safe mode to disable all addons, same issue

I have tried a VPN, doesn't seem to help, makes it worse if anything else

I have tried alternate Twitch player, slightly less delay but still a lot more than I'd like and should get

About “emotional baggage” and men’s sensitivity towards women	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	7	12	"There was a woman here who asked for advice on her Tinder profile, and she got massive (negative) feedback on her line “no emotional baggage”. I wanted to write this in the thread but it is locked now so I rather do a new thread and bring this up because there were so many negative comments while I didn’t see that anyone understood what she meant OR could differ between being honest/vulnerable and being emotionally immature and dumping baggage in the lap of a date/gf. 

I immediately thought she meant that she don’t want to date guys that drag her down because they don’t take responsibility for their mental health and work on learning to be accountable and not do self-pity and dump a bag of emotional baggage on their partner. I then saw in her comments that it was something like that she meant.
All abusers, all narcissists, all immature people, men in this case, just drags around a bag of miserable and dump on their partners. I’m bisexual and my abusive and very emotionally immature ex *gf* did this. I see that many guys in the thread says “they tells you to open up when you do they get freaked out”. Bohoo. Then they make a leap into “so women really want toxic masculinity and not sensitive guys”. 

Holding your date/gf responsible for your emotional baggage IS toxic masculinity. There isn’t one man out there who abuses women who won’t be using excuses for it like their childhood or what their ex did. Or “I’m depressed”. Or “I have anxiety”. 
To not take responsibility for your feelings, maturity and growth and just dump it all in the lap of a woman is to be toxic. 

A sensitive man that is MATURE and who has taken responsibility for his mental health through having gone to therapy, made sure to build a support network, have studied psychology (at home, on free time) and tried to learn how to communicate and deal with his feelings is attractive. Someone who won’t project and be nasty towards his partner when he feels triggered. Someone who won’t go around for years being absolutely miserable on the inside and holding up a facade for the rest of the world but just fall apart in front of their gf and expect to be miserable around them all the time. 
I know none of you wants to date a woman who does that either!
Being vulnerable is not the same as to treat a date like a psychologist and just fall apart in front of them and dump 15 years of trauma on to them. 
Being vulnerable means to not use safety measures such as being mean or sarcastic because you deep down feel scared to be intimate and have trust issues.
Being vulnerable is being honest about how you feel without automatically assuming the other person now is responsible for your feelings. It takes work to become mature in relationships. You can have trauma and a shitty upbringing but it is your responsibility to work on that as an adult and not just numb it out, have a facade for friends and college and then just use a date or partner as a relief to let it all blurt out on. 
She meant something similar to that but the majority of guys reading it automatically thought she said “you can’t have experienced heartache, abandonment, stress etc”."	Tinder	2022-07-02T08:23:28.000Z	Song-to-the-siren-

I'm already exhausted	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	8	8	"I (F) am turning 30 this summer, so I thought that after a long while of being single I can try this dating app thing and maybe meet someone.

It's been three days and I'm so tired. How do you talk to people? I try so hard to keep conversations going, but talking is so hard. I don't want to ghost anyone, but sometimes dialogues just die. Some people seem entirely uninterested from the very start, which makes me think they matched with me as backup and I'm in no way their first choice. Can't blame them, but it's... tiring.

I swipe based on bios because I want someone who is into the same things as me, but all y'alls bios are empty and you have ""iced tea"" as a passion.

Speaking of, passions are such an annoying feature, I'm not sure why it's even there. Most passions are so vague they give you almost no info on what the person might be into (unless they have NFTs and Investing combo, I guess). Not to mention that a lot of people don't even bother to pick all 5. You pick 3.

Then there's the fact that the app triggered every single one of my personal insecurities. The pictures I took show my ""good angles"" and now I'm paranoid that if I meet any of these people irl, they're going to see my ""bad side"" and bail. I feel kinda awful about myself. I don't wear makeup day-to-day, but wore it for this one(1) picture, looked at it for 6 hours and decided that it's ""too deceiving"" before deleting it from Tinder.

My mood has just steadily plummeted ever since I joined the app. Is this normal? Is I worth it? I work from home and don't like socialising in public, so it's kinda the best way for me to meet anyone 😬"	Tinder	2022-07-01T22:47:28.000Z	StaleSushiRolls

I have a computer with a M.2 drive with Windows on. I then installed another M.2 drive in my secondary M.2 slot (this had Linux on it). The reason behind this was to start my pc normally and then format that Linux drive. However no matter what I did in BIOS, the computer always wanted to boot from that Linux drive. I tried everything to get it to boot from my Windows M.2. Eventually I gave up and removed the Linux M.2 and now the only drive in my computer is the main Windows M.2

But now my computer won't boot. I am getting the ""Insert boot media in selected boot device and press a key""... 

I have not taken another M.2 drive with Windows on and put it in the slot where the Linux drive was installed and am not booted into Windows. If I run diskmgmt.msc I can see that both disks are connected but still it won't let me boot from my main M.2 Drive...

PC makes ~10 beeps on startup but is doing fine	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	1	"Hey, sorry if this is the wrong the subreddit, but I'm a bit annoyed by my PC.

It's now been a year since I've started hearing 10 beeps on startup of my PC. It's doing completely fine, someone told me it might be a RAM issue but idk, he told me that months ago and my RAM hasn't given up since, everything seems to work in my PC.

I guess the problem might come from my specs:

CPU Xeon E5 2620 v3

Mobo Atermiter X99

RAM Atermiter 2x8G 1866MHz

GPU MSI GT710 2G

PSU no name 500W

The CPU, motherboard and RAM all come for the same manufacturer from Aliexpress, maybe their tech is faulty, but I guess it could also be because of that PSU (found it in a landfill).

USB Ports refresh every so often	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	0	2	"May not seem like a big deal, but it gets a bit annoying. I'll be mid match on any game and I notice my controller flashes cause it's ""rebooting.""

Steps I've taken to troubleshoot:

1. Turned off power management through both the device manager and the power management settings. (Separately through each USB port and on the power management overview)
2. Bought a new USB cable to see if it was the cable.
3. Changed the USB port the controller is plugged into.
4. Updated firmware for the controller. (Notice how all of it is via the controller because it doesn't happen slow enough for me to notice via my other devices.)
5. Updated windows software.

Is it the controller or a motherboard issue? I don't think it's the power supply as it would reboot my whole computer if it's drawing that much power, but I wonder if the motherboard is not able to provide that much power overall to the USB ports in the back. 

It's a PS5 controller. (Use it for FFXIV) I noticed that one time, I was in my device manager and the whole page refreshed at the same time as my controller reconnecting."	techsupport	2022-07-02T07:49:20.000Z	filipinopepper

But the Diamondbacks and the Marlins both already have stadiums around the area of spring training, which presumably have nicer facilities than what a spring training camp will provide.

I was unable to attend her funeral or even visit her in the hospital as the news of her death reached me after the funeral. After visiting her mother who was living alone after her daughter passed, she later asked for my contact information and during our chat we reminisced of our memories of her. The girl told me that her hobby was classical ballet so the mother sent me the girl’s ballet pictures. 

Later on, I told her that I was frustrated for not being able to see her at the hospital or the funeral and her mother sent me photos of the girl’s funeral and her casket photo. It was difficult for me to compose myself before apologizing to the mother.

But in addition to mass, the food is also converted into energy for locomotion and such, right? What is that process like?

The scammy side of Insta is creeping me out - can someone explain?	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"Haven't had Insta for terribly long, a few months. I am a man. I'm not an active user, few photos only, everything is private etc. I noticed some weird things happening and brushed it off but in the last two weeks I noticed even more weird stuff and so I have decided to de-activate for now.

Specifically, I received requests from what looked like three girl mates within the space of a week which seemed odd. I messaged them as I thought something seemed weird, and they all told me that they were fake profiles. Two of the profiles were just regular pictures, no nudes or anything like that. It made me wonder, if there's not some nudes or something, why is someone replicating their profile and then trying to add me? What are they getting out of that? It's strange.

I also take an interest online in some things, dropshipping, football betting. I watch Youtube videos on these things, I read up online, just all the usual stuff as anyone would with any interests they have. I've had instagram requests from 'football betting tipsters' and 'dropshipping experts' literally a day or two after I engaged with online content. Who are these people and how the hell are they connecting with my Insta profile? My insta username isn't anywhere online, and I don't publish my name on Youtube or anything.

I'm struggling to piece these things together. Can someone explain how this all works and what these people are trying to achieve (for this latter point, specifically the example of the 3 girl mates being scammed)? I don't recall this weird stuff on Facebook or other platforms and this creepy side to it is making me not want to return."	Instagram	2022-07-02T12:52:16.000Z	davetheblagger

As if we don't already do all of that gumf and yet still end up with very little engagement or reach because none if it guarantees that the stars will align in your favour and Instagram will actually show your content to people instead of burying it.

Even bigger brands and companies are having a hard time with Instagram now and that speaks volumes about the state of the platform for everyone across the board.

Having a ""social media strat"" and just isn't going to cut it or guarantee success or sales anymore because the algorithm keeps being tweaked and broken every five seconds - hence being unable to apply an actual strategy long enough to even see any results.

“Temporarily” locked out of my account! Help	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	1	1	"Hello r/Instagram, sorry if this is the wrong place for these type of posts.

A few weeks ago I was cleaning out my phone apps when I had came across the old “follower” Instagram app I used to use. I opened the app and conveniently enough it had remembered my login from last time. I login and it isn’t anything crazy, so I delete the app not long after opening it. After cleaning out the rest of my apps and trying to open Instagram, I get hit with a screen that says: 

“Your account has been temporarily locked”
“We’be detected suspicious activity in your account… locked it as a security precaution”

The only problem with logging back into my account is that the email I used to use with the account is no longer working. Upon trying to to login to the email account the Instagram is associated with, I get asked to confirm it’s me by putting in a code texted to the phone number on the account. Only issue is that I also don’t have access to that phone number anymore. 

I know I should update my 2-step verification for every account, but I didn’t even think twice about Instagram and didn’t even know a temporary lock an account was a thing. There may not be alot of options , but I’m pretty desperate.

After having it back for 12 days I got disabled on December 12th 2021. Been waiting 7 months no reply’s to my appeals except something about not having enough workers because of Covid . Has anyone heard anything from ig support lately ?	Instagram	2022-07-01T22:15:28.000Z	SpillyBallout
Reels stuck at 0 views	com.example.redditnegative.model.RedditPost	2	1	"My reels on my business account we’re doing well with 30k views + each. I deleted one due to a typo and since then my reels all get 0 views. That video had 0 views when I deleted it. The content I’m posting now is similar, the quality is the same and the hashtags are the same. Confused - am I being punished for deleting? 

I’ve updated, logged in/out, use trending audios, etc. and still 0 views. Sometimes they get like 6 views if I am lucky. Seems like they stopped pushing my videos out. Anyone have any advice?"	Instagram	2022-07-01T22:11:12.000Z	KristenTatas
